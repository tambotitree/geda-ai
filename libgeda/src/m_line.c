/*! \brief Calculates the distance between the given point and the closest
 *  point on the given line segment.
 *
 *  If the closest point on the line resides beyond the line segment's
 *  end point, this function returns the distance from the given point to the
 *  closest end point.
 *
 *  If the line represents a single point (the endpoints are the same), this
 *  function calcualtes the distance to that point.
 *
 *  \param [in] line  The LINE object.
 *  \param [in] x     The x coordinate of the given point.
 *  \param [in] y     The y coordinate of the given point.
 *  \return The shortest distance from the object to the point. With an
 *  invalid parameter, this function returns G_MAXDOUBLE.
