2007-05-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20070526 in prep for the next
        release.  Also changed shared library's version number to 29:0:0.

2007-05-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/o_text_basic.c: Fixed a memory leak reported by Peter Brett
	(found using valgrind).  Thanks.

2007-04-28  Stuart Brorson <sdb AT cloud9 DOT net>
	* src/o_attrib.c, src/o_complex_basic.c, src/s_tile.c:
	made changes to o_attrib_slot_update and
	o_attrib_search_pinseq to enable searching slotted parts 
	by pinseq.  Added o_complex_count_pins as part of project.
	
2007-04-22  Peter Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>
	* src/o_box_basic.c: Fix some unused variable warnings in libgeda.
	
	  In a recent patch libgd was disabled by default (i.e.  HAS_LIBGD
	  was unset by default).  This exposed some variable declarations
	  which should have been #ifdefed out, but weren't.  Although most
	  were later cleared up, some were missed.
	
2007-04-21  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@sentex.ca>

	* src/f_print.c:
	  - Added %%Orientation to DSC block in PS output, fixing SF#1680214.

2007-04-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves (AT) iespana (DOT) es>

	* src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
	  src/o_pin_basic.c: 
	  - Put unused variables inside #ifdef HAS_LIBGD.
	  - Reverted the patch below. Those variables are used when 
	    compiling with libgd.
	  - Removed unused variables.

	* configure.ac: Don't enable libgd by default.
	  This makes gdk-pixbuf the default library for png output.
	
2007-04-21 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

	* src/m_basic.c: Fix visibility test in visible(..) for the case when the
	  object completely surrounds the screen clipping region.

	* src/o_circle_basic.c: Tidy up dist() function in o_circle_basic.c
	  to be much more readable.

2007-04-17 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

	Merge changes from noscreen
	
	2007-16-06 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* src/o_text_basic.c: Use o_text_recalc() to update bounds, as we don't
		  want to duplicate code. Fixes a bug where the bounds were reset manually
		  even with invisible text (causing uninitialised values to be stored in
		  for the object's bounds). Fixed o_text_recalc() to silently return
		  (rather than write uninitialised values) if no bound was found for the
		  text object's prim_objects.

	2007-12-06 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* src/f_image.c, src/f_print.c, src/g_smob.c, src/o_complex_basic.c,
		  src/o_pin_basic.c: Replace incorrect use of world_get_complex_bounds()
		  with world_get_object_list_bounds(). Changed o_complex_recalc() to
		  (correctly) use world_complex_get_bounds(). Fixed up documentation in
		  g_smob.c to reflect the current bounds code.

	2007-04-06 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* src/a_basic.c: Fix bounds for embedded objects as they are loaded from
		  file. This places a call to o_complex_recalc() in o_read(), which is
		  not great from an encapsulation point of view, but is the neatest solution
		  with the current method of loading embedded objects.

	2007-03-26 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
		  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
		  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c: Pass OBJECT instead
		  of derived type into world_get_..._bounds(). Modifed objects to include
		  the drawn line width when calculating bounds. Set OBJECT->line_width to
		  {NET|BUS|PIN}_WIDTH as appropriate in o_{net|bus|pin}_add(). Replaced
		  copied code in world_get_{net|pin|bus}_bounds() with calls to
		  world_get_line_bounds(). Added call to o_recalc_single_object() in
		  o_set_line_options() to keep line width up-to-date with editing.

		* libgeda/include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: Added variables
		  to support (select-slack-pixels #) rc keyword.

	2007-03-24 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* src/o_complex_basic.c: Convert world_get_complex_bounds() to
		  be a wrapper around world_get_list_bounds(). Based upon a patch
		  by Patrick Bernaud which did the same for get_complex_bounds().

		* src/o_pin_basic.c: Re-write the bounds checking in o_pin_update_whichend()
		  to be more robust

		* src/o_complex_basic.c: Modify world_get_single_object_bounds() to
		  use cached bounds where possible. Text objects are special-cased
		  to determine if they are visible.

		* src/o_complex_basic.c: Add call to o_complex_recalc() in o_complex_add()
		  to cache bounds.

	2007-02-25 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c, 
		  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c, 
		  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c,
		  src/o_text_basic.c: Removed get_..._bounds() functions.

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
		  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_complex_basic.c,
		  src/o_line_basic.c, src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c,
		  src/o_pin_basic.c, src/o_text_basic.c: Switched over to
		  caching world rather than screen coordinates

		* include/struch.h, src/s_basic.c: Removed screen coordinates from
		  object datastructures, and renamed variables storing cached
		  bounds with prefix w_ to differentiate their world coord usage.
		  Changed s_basic.c to initialise all these variables to zero.

		* src/o_text_basic.c: Added call to o_text_recalc() to
		  o_text_recreate(), since we should automatically keep
		  all cached coordiantes up to date.

		* src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_bus_basic.c,
		  src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_complex_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
		  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c: Tidied
		  world_get_..._bounds() functions to use simple min() max()
		  implementations where appropriate. Fixed world_get_arc_bounds()
		  to have same semantics as the other functions, IE. top and bottom
		  swapped to give bottom > top numerically.

		* src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_bus_basic.c,
		  src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c, src/o_net_basic.c,
		  src/o_pin_basic.c: Modified PNG export routines to calculate
		  coordinates directly from object world coords.

2007-04-06 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/g_smob.c: make g_get_object_type scheme function return 
	  a character instead of a string.
	
	* include/o_types.h, include/prototype.h, src/g_register.c, 
	  src/libgeda.c : 

	  Register the OBJ_* object type definitions as scheme character 
	  variables.

2007-04-05 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c: Added two new scheme functions:

	    - g_calcule_new_attrib_bounds: calcule the new bounds of an 
	      attribute with the given parameters, _without_ modifying the 
	      attribute.

	    - g_get_attrib_value_by_attrib_name: given an object and an 
	      attribute name, this function returns a list with the values
	      of the attributes with the given name in that object.

2007-02-24 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

	Merge changes to date from noscreen branch.

	2007-02-12 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_basic.c,
		  src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
		  src/o_picture.c: Removed o_object_recalc() and all calls
		  to it now the data it calculates is no longer used.

		* src/m_basic.c: Remove implicit grid snapping in SCREENtoWOLRD()

	2006-12-30 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_basic.c: Changed variable names and 
		  comments to function inside_region() to allow its use with world
		  coordinates without apparently swapping top and bottom (which have
		  different sense in screen and world coords. Now uses {x/y}{min/max}.

	2006-12-27 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c, 
		  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_complex_basic.c, 
		  src/o_line_basic.c, src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, 
		  src/o_pin_basic.c: Removed o_..._translate() functions which
		  are unused.

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
		  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
		  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c,
		  src/o_text_basic.c: Removed o_..._rotate() functions unused
		  since changing to world coordinates

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
		  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
		  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c,
		  src/o_text_basic.c: Removed o_..._mirror() functions unused
		  since changing to world coordinates

2007-02-24 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
	
	* include/struct.h, src/s_page.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Removed unused
	fields in PAGE and TOPLEVEL as well as functions for old (GtkCList
	based) page manager. (Patch written by Patrick Bernaud)

2007-02-14 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* autogen.sh: Removed debug messages added on 2007-02-10.

2007-02-11 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

	* src/s_toplevel.c: added missing toplevel inits (tshowwindow, ...)

2007-02-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/funcs.h: Removed quit_func since it is completely unused.

	* include/prototype.h, src/f_basic.c, src/o_arc_basic.c: Fixed
	a whole bunch of compiler warnings and work on [ 1620806 ]
	various probably bugs and comments about them

	* configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20070216.  Also changed
	shared library's version number to 28:0:0

2007-02-10 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/f_print.c: Make f_print_header return an error return value
	  if something goes wrong, and propagate it to the caller functions.
	  Unlink the file created by f_print_file if there is an error in
	  f_print_header.
	
	* autogen.sh: Added automake version number check.

2007-02-10  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@sentex.ca>

	* include/struct.h, src/o_text_basic.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Added
	code to scale the output postscript font under user control.  This
	is controlled via the postscript-font-scale rc keyword.

2007-02-10  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@sentex.ca>

	* src/f_print.c: Applied Wojciech Kazubski's patch for offset
	printing orgins. Fixes bug #160757

2007-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/o_arc_basic.c: Applied patch by Peter Clifton to fix
	the output of arcs when using libgd.

	* src/Makefile.am: Applied patch by Peter Clifton to add --silent to
	libtool.

2007-01-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/prototype.h, src/Makefile.am, src/o_embed.c: Moved
	o_embed(...) and o_unembed(...) into o_embed.c so that gschlas
	can also call these useful functions (to support scriptable 
	embedding and unembedding of components).

	* src/.cvsignore: Oops, remove obsolete *.c rule that was causing
	cvs to ignore new (but not added) C files.

2006-12-26 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c:
	  Added a new scheme function: get-page-filename, returning
	  the page filename of the given page.
	
2006-12-21 Peter Brett   <peter@peter-b.co.uk>

	* include/prototype.h, src/o_selection.c: Update interface of
	o_selection_print_all() to match other o_selection_*() functions. Pass 
	the GList by reference.

	* include/prototype.h: Comment o_selection_select() and
	o_selection_unselect() as deprecated (should only be used internally to
	libgeda).

	* include/prototype.h, src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_selection.c:
	Update interface of o_selection_add() to match
	o_selection_remove(). Pass the GList by reference so head can be
	updated.
	
2006-12-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	Merged Carlos' glist work via Peter Brett's patch sets to the trunk

	2006-10-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

		* src/s_page.c: Don't free objects in the complex place
		list. It is only a reference to the objects in the page.

	2006-10-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

		* include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, src/o_basic.c,
		src/o_complex_basic.c, src/o_list.c, src/o_net_basic.c,
		src/o_selection.c, src/s_basic.c, src/s_page.c, Convert
		the SELECTION list into a GList.  Added new functions
		o_recalc_object_glist, get_object_glist_bounds to
		handle glists.

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_basic.c: Rename o_recalc to
		o_recalc_object_list, and make it to call a new function
		o_recalc_single_object, for each object in the list.

		* include/prototype.h, src/o_complex_basic.c,
		src/o_text_basic.c: Rename get_complex_bounds to
		get_object_list_bounds, and make it to call a new function
		get_single_object_bounds, for each object in the list.
	
		* src/o_complex_basic.c: Fixed logic level of some checks.
		* src/o_complex_basic.c: Added some sanity checks.

2006-12-16 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

	 * include/struct.h: added widget pointers for the modal dialogs
	   find text, show text, hide text

2006-12-13 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c:
	  Added a new scheme function: get-object-type, returning
	  the object type (object->type as a scheme string) of the given
	  object.
	
2006-12-05 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/prototype.h, src/s_clib.c: Converted the clib_directories 
	  list into a double linked list and reversed the search order
	  (last added directories first).

	* include/prototype.h, src/o_complex_basic.c:
	  Added new function world_get_single_object_bounds to calculate
	  the bounds of a single object, and make world_get_complex_bounds
	  call it.

	* include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c:
	  Added new scheme function get-attrib-angle. It returns the angle
	  of the given attribute.
	  Also made a minor fix to the documentation of g_get_attrib_bounds.
	
2006-12-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_toplevel.c: Added missing init of toplevel->line_style
	(all variables in the TOPLEVEL struct ure should be initalized).

2006-12-02  Mike Jarabek  <mike@laptop.istop.com>

	* include/defines.h include/struct.h: Added
	  toplevel->line_style'. This new entry is a flag to set whether
	  or not lines are drawn really thin on the output postscript or
	  will only be drawn to the width of pins or nets.

	* src/o_arc_basic.c src/o_box_basic.c src/o_circle_basic.c
	  libgeda/src/o_line_basic.c: Changes to the postscript output
	  code to ensure that lines can't be drawn too thin.

2006-12-02 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/o_bus_basic.c: Added missing call to s_tile_update_object
	for buses.  This missing call could cause buses to not have
	correct connectivity when using grips.	Pointed out by and patch
	by Peter Clifton.

2006-11-21 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

	* include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: readded toplevel->filename_label
	  to the toplevel structure, it's still required by gattib.
	  fixes Bug [#1600448]

2006-11-19 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

	* include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: moved schematic title
	  from the status bar to the window title. Added grid settings
	  to the status bar:
	  replaced toplevel->filename_label with toplevel->grid_label

2006-11-01 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c: Added new "get-attribute-bounds"
	  scheme function.

2006-10-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20061020.
	
	* configure.ac: Bumped shared library version to 27:0:0

2006-10-19  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* configure.ac: Cleaned up to remove remaining traces of noweb
	days.

	* noweb/.cvsignore: Removed file for directory to get pruned on
	checkout.

	* docs/libgedadoc.texi, docs/texinfo.tex: Removed unused files for
	old noweb documentation.

	* scripts/geda_totexi.in:
	* scripts/notangle_guile.in:
	* scripts/prepnoweb: Removed unused scripts for noweb.

2006-10-17  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/o_text_basic.c (o_text_create_string): Fixed overbar feature
	to work with UTF-8 characters (Bug#1578416).

2006-10-04 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c:
	Removed the new variable to track wether the main window is maximized
	or not. It's no more necessary due to the patch from Patrick Bernaud.

2006-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c:
	Added a new variable to track wether the main window is maximized
	or not. This is part of the bug #1527465 fix.

2006-09-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/a_basic.c: Fixed a memory leak in o_save when saving 
	complex objects.  Not a large leak, but this function gets called
	all the time when recording undo info.  Found using valgrind.

	* src/s_page.c: Added check to fix Bug#1562352 (Gattrib crashes
	doing file-save when no files open)

2006-09-28 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, src/g_smob.c:
	  Added new page smob.
	
2006-09-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* configure.ac : Applied patch #1564796 by Cesar Strauss, 
	enabling Cygwin's compilation. Thanks.
	
2006-09-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * AUTHORS: Updated file pointing people at gschem's AUTHOR file 
        as the complete list of authors.  Merged all listed files in this
        file into gschem's file.

2006-09-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Tweaked glib detection to not fail ./configure
	when gdlib is not installed.  gdlib is an optional dependancy.

2006-09-24 03:57  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac, libgeda.pc.in: Improve gdlib detection.  Now
	  instead of just dropping gd support if gdlib is not found, have
	  configure error out with a message that tells the user what needs
	  to be fixed or what feature will be missing if --disable-gd is
	  used.

	  Also add a variable to libgeda.pc.in so pkg-config can determine
	  if libgeda was compiled with gdlib support.  This makes
	  determination of this by gschem more robust.

2006-09-23  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* include/defines.h: 
	* include/struct.h: Removed unused constants and structures
	because of new file selection and component selection dialogs in
	gschem.

	* include/struct.h: Changed type of field 'preview' in
	st_filedialog to GtkWidget*.

	* src/s_toplevel.c (s_toplevel_new): Added missing init of
	rotated_inside.

2006-09-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* README, configure.ac, include/globals.h, src/f_image.c,
	  src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_bus_basic.c,
	  src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_image.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
	  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_pin_basic.c, src/s_color.c,
	  src/s_cue.c: 
	  Use gd 2.0.x library instead of libgdgeda.
	  libgdgeda is not used anymore. Work based on a patch by
	  Wojciech Kazubski (patch #1479983).
	
2006-09-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Updated program version to 20060906.

	* share/Makefile.am: Changed the install directory of prolog.ps
	to the DATA directory and not the RC directory since that is
	where system-gafrc is looking for it.  This bug was found when
	--with-rcdir was used.  This fix is related to Bug#1552338.

	* include/defines.h: Added CUSTOM_VERSION string #define.  
	Normally this #define defines an empty string, but for those 
	people who need to spin a custom version of gEDA/gaf (of course,
	following the licensing/distribution requirements of the GPL), they
	can set this to a string which is appended to printfs/output/dialog 
	boxes where VERSION is used.

2006-09-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_toplevel.c: Added code to s_toplevel_delete 
	to check for and remove a GSource before it is deleted.  Patch by
	Patrick Bernaud.  Thanks!

	* src/s_page.c: Added s_page_autosave_init to setup the autosave
	callback (instead of doing it in i_vars_set) which was also
	be set in the preview toplevel (having the callback there is
	undesirable).

	* src/s_toplevel.c: Added the init of auto_save_timeout in 
	s_toplevel_new().  Pointed out by PeterC and this make valgrind
	happy again.

2006-09-02  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/s_toplevel.c (s_toplevel_new): Added missing initialization
	of TOPLEVEL print_command.

2006-08-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated gtk+ tests to look for 2.4.x or greater.

	* src/o_attrib.c: fix for Bug#1547138: Segfault on adding 
	  toplevel slot attribute to symbol

2006-08-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h,
	src/f_print.c, src/i_vars.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Applied first
	part of patch by Peter Brett to add a new print dialog to
	gschem.  Patch#1530417.

2006-08-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/Makefile.am: Removed old VPATH, since it is no longer needed
        and it is interfering with make distcheck

	* share/Makefile.am: Added prolog.ps to EXTRA_DIST to make distcheck
	happy (and it was missing from the dist in general).

2006-08-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * README: Updated the README a little to be ready for the next
        release.

2006-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version number to 20060821 in prep for the
        next gEDA/gaf release.  Also changed the so version of libgeda to
	26:0:0

2006-08-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/*.c: Applied Patch#1533798: Remove pre-GTK2 code from geda
	by Peter Brett.

	* src/a_basic.c: Applied Patch#1534089: libgeda: bugfix for
	segfault when loading corrupted file by Tomaz Solc.

	* include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: Added keyboardpan_gain
	variable to TOPLEVEL

2006-07-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_toplevel.c: Added initialization of missing variable 
	(toplevel->prev).  This caused a rare segmentation fault 
	(Bug#1528080)

2006-07-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/defines.h: Applied mouse pan patch by Peter Clifton. 
	(Patch #1527361): Allow middle button panning in gschem

	* include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: Added variables to support
	(mousepan-gain #) rc keyword.

2006-07-23  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

	* src/o_text_basic.c: Fixed 180 degree rotated text so that it
	prints upside right unstead of upside down in the postscipt
	back end.

2006-07-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/a_basic.c, src/f_basic.c, src/f_print.c, src/g_basic.c,
	src/g_rc.c, src/g_smob.c, src/i_vars.c, src/o_arc_basic.c,
	src/o_attrib.c, src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_bus_basic.c, 
	src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_complex_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
	src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c,

	src/s_papersizes.c, src/s_slib.c, src/s_stretch.c, src/s_tile.c,
	src/s_undo.c, src/u_basic.c: Converted all free, ?alloc, and 
	strdup calls to use g_free, g_?alloc, and g_strdup.  This is the
	first phase in fixing the slice crash under glib 2.10.x.

	* src/libgeda.c: Clarified putenv/free comment

	* src/o_attrib.c, src/o_complex_basic.c src/o_text_basic.c: 
	Removed some residual noweb #lines and comments

	* src/s_conn.c: Finally figured out that setting a freed object's
	data field was causing lots of trouble for glib's slice allocator.

	* src/s_basic.c src/o_picture.c: Changed all g_free() calls on
	all pixbufs to be g_object_unref.  This was causing crashes with
	glib 2.10.x.

	* src/o_attrib.c: Added todo to an if statement that causes an
	invalid read

2006-07-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* libgeda.pc.in: Re-Fixed incorrect order of macros.  Reverted back
	to the previous order, since the new order is clearly wrong on other
	platforms than FreeBSD.  

2006-07-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* Integrated noweb removal patch by Jason Childs.  Changed default
	target in docs/Makefile.am to not build the docs by default; this
	is to speed up the build. 

	* src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/s_cue.c:
	Merged changes from the .nw files to the c files that Mike made
	related to removing mils from PS output.

	* src/g_rc.c, o_complex_basic.c: Merged changes from the .nw files
	to the .c files that I made just recently.

	* noweb/*.nw, Makefile.am: Removed all files 

2006-07-04 Jason Childs <oblivian@users.sourceforge.net>

 	* noweb/a_basic.nw, noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/f_image.nw,

 	  noweb/s_slib.nw, noweb/s_stretch.nw, noweb/s_tile.nw,
 	  noweb/s_toplevel.nw, noweb/s_undo.nw, noweb/u_basic.nw:
 	Ported as real c source code file in the src directory.
 	Deleted after porting all noweb comments into doxygen format
 	in respective c source files.
 	
 	* noweb: Removed subdirectory.
 	
 	* src/Makefile.am: Updated to build from c source instead of noweb.
 	Fixed distclean setup to not remove c source files.

 	* docs/Makefile.am: Added support for Doxygen html and LaTex
 	documents. Fixed distclean setup to not remove required Doxygen html
 	files, and to remove html and latex subdirectories on clean.
 	
 	* Makefile.am: Removed noweb as a buildable subdirectory.
 	
 	* configure.ac: Removed checks for noweb and texi2html.
 	Added check for Doxygen.

2006-07-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* libgeda.pc.in: Fixed incorrect order of macros.  Discovered by
	reading USENET's FreeBSD commit logs. :-)

	* noweb/g_rc.nw, o_complex_basic.nw: Minor bug fix to properly 
	promotion code to properly promote only specified changes.  

2006-07-03  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

	* noweb/o_arc_basic.nw, noweb/o_circle_basic.nw, noweb/s_cue.nw:

2006-06-16 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de

	* noweb/f_basic.nw: fixed noweb chunk error

	* noweb/s_page.nw: added function to find a page by it's id

	* noweb/s_hierarchy.nw: added s_hierarchy_traversepages(), it
	  returns a list of pages either in preorder order
	  s_hierarchy_print_page(): test function used for traversing
	  in s_hierarchy_down_schematic_single(): added page loop detector.

	* include/defines.h: added some flags for s_hierarchy*
	
2006-06-02  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

	* noweb/f_print.nw: Added code to check flag for vector vs. PS
	  text output in text f_print_objects().

2006-05-22  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

	* share/prolog.ps: Added custom stringwidth function to printing
	  routines that handles overbar characters.  Added overbar drawing
	  support.  The overbar thickness is coded to be 10% of the font
	  size.  The height of the overbar is set to the font size.

2006-05-21 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de:

	* src/Makefile.am: moved the comment sign to the first column.
	  "make reconfig" is happy now.

2006-05-20 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/Makefile.am: Commented out the indentation of the C code, 
	so gdb can return correct information when debugging.
	
	* noweb/s_page.nw: Added one more sanity check.

	* include/struct.h: Moved rotated_inside into the TOPLEVEL structure.
	
2006-05-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * scripts/notangle_guile.in: Applied patch by Steve Brown to fix
        guile stack overflow

	* noweb/f_print.nw: Fixed missing @ which made notangle_guile a 
	little happier.

	* include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, 
	noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/i_vars.nw,
	noweb/o_complex_basic.nw, noweb/s_toplevel.nw: Finally added code
	to support the rc keyword: always-promote-attributes.  This string
	holds a list of attribute names that are always promoted.

	* src/Makefile.am: Changed the .nw.c: rule to redirect the generated 
        C file to a temp file and then move it to the real one.  This fixes 
        the stale file problem when notangle fails.

	* noweb/s_toplevel.nw: Added missing variable init 

2006-05-17  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac

	* share/Makefile.am
	  New makefile to install prolog.

2006-05-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/struct.h: Added variable which controls if the user
	  can move objects just dragging them.

2006-04-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Allow rotation and mirroring of
	  complex objects inside complex objects.

2006-04-14 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
	* noweb/f_basic.nw: added <time.h> for f_open()
	  compiler warning was: implicit declaration function of difftime()

2006-04-13 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
	* noweb/f_print.nw: added <time.h> for f_print_header()
	
2006-04-09 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	reporting the bug.
	
2006-03-03 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Finish the overbar if the ending overbar
	delimiter is omitted. Feature suggested by Enoch H. Wexler. Thanks.
	
2006-02-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw:
	Added support for overbars. Delimiter character for the overbar is
	"\_" string (it should be at the beginning and at the end of the 
	overbar). Support for overbars in Postscript code needs to be done.

2006-02-26 Mike Jarabek <mjarabek@istop.com>
	* noweb/f_print.nw:
	  Added DSC comments and logic to f_print() so that page managers
	  can make more intelligent choices about paper sizes.  The code
	  lies about the actual extents, and so does not completely obey
	  the DSC rules.

2006-02-25 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
	
        * include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, noweb/g_smob.nw:
	  Added new smob functions for OBJECT type.
	
	* include/prototype.h, noweb/s_color.nw: 
	  Added a new function returning the index of a given color name.
	
2006-02-25 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/f_basic.nw: Set the backup file readonly, so an 'rm *'
	command will ask the user if he really wants to delete the file.
	When loading an autosave backup file, set the page as changed.
	Thus, when the user closes the page, gschem will ask him wether to
	save it or not.

2006-01-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* autogen.sh, m4/gettext.m4: Removed m4 files since they are 
	installation specific

2006-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20060123 and also 
	change the shared library's version to 25:0:0

        * README: Updated for the new year and release.

2006-01-07 Stuart Brorson <sdb AT cloud9 DOT net>
	* autogen.sh, m4/gettext.m4: Included "-I m4" into
	aclocal to pick up gettext.m4 from local dir.
	
2006-01-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/s_encoding.nw: Removed extra @'s since they are no longer
	required for either notangle_guile or notangle (noweb proper) and
	they were breaking the build for notangle_guile.  Thank to Stuart
	and Matthias Wenzel for the fix.

2005-12-02 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
	* noweb/s_page.nw: Make the s_page_autosave function more 
	failproof, checking all the pointers. This change, together 
	with some gschem changes at the same date will fix some gschem 
	crashes reported by David Carr. Thanks David!

2005-11-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
	* noweb/s_encoding.nw: Break some lines so notangle_guile
	doesn't get confused by noweb scape sequences.
	
2005-11-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
        * include/funcs.h, include/struct.h, noweb/f_basic.nw,
	  noweb/s_page.nw:
	Added definition of the autosave backup filename string.
	Added check for a backup file when loading a schematic, 
	and a function to call an app-dependant function to ask 
	the user if the backup file should be loaded or not.
	
2005-11-18 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
	* include/struct.h, noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/s_page.nw:
	Changed autosave code so the timer callback doesn't do the
	autosave backups. Now are made within o_undo_savestate, so
	backups will ONLY be saved when there was a change to the 
	schematic and there was a timeout of the autosave timer.
	
2005-11-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/prototype.h, noweb/s_conn.nw: Added search routine which
	is used in determining if a net segment (of the "L") connects to 
	something else.

2005-10-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/s_log.nw: Added an if to get rid of an assert from glib if
	the logfile_fd is not initialized.  Bug reported by John Luciani.

	* include/defines.h, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h,
	  noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/s_page.nw, noweb/s_toplevel.nw,
	  noweb/s_undo.nw:
	  Added support for backup copies and autosaving every 
	  "interval" seconds.
	  
2005-10-15 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>	
        * noweb/f_image.nw:
	Print error if calling f_image_write without libgdgeda support.
	
2005-10-05 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
	* include/struct.h: added the net-drawing patch from David Carr
	it requires two additional coordinates in st_toplevel

2005-10-01 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	for pointing out the solution.

2005-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	* include/struct.h, noweb/o_picture.nw:
	Added embedded variable to the picture struct and initialize it.
	* include/prototypes.h, noweb/Makefile.am, noweb/s_encoding.nw,
	  src/Makefile.am:
	Added new file containing functions for base64 encoding/decoding.

        * configure.ac: Bumped the package version to 20050820 which will be
        a real snapshot.

2005-08-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/g_basic.nw: Applied patch by Carlos Azevedo which fully expands
	the path of an rc file, so that it can be found.

	* include/struct.h, noweb/s_toplevel.nw: Added add_attribute_offset 
	rc variable to TOPLEVEL.

	* include/struct.h, noweb/s_toplevel.nw: Added grid_mode and 
	grid_spacing rc variables to TOPLEVEL.

        message if gtk+ 2.2.x is not found.

2005-03-11  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/g_rc.nw (g_rc_map_font_character_to_file): Adapted for the
	new char-to-file hash table.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Improved memory use and global efficiency
	in the unicode support: hash tables now takes a gunichar as key.
	Also removed GTK 1.2 specific code.

2005-03-11 7:05 Sturt Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* noweb/s_toplevel.nw: Added initialization of toplevel_head->next

	  noweb/o_text_basic.nw, include/prototype.h, include/defines.h,
	  noweb/s_toplevel.nw:
	  Added Unicode support, character to font file mapping by hashtable,
	  and font mapping definition using system-gafrc.
	
2005-02-28  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

2005-02-21 05:38  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: if we are using gcc, add -Wall

2005-02-21 03:58  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* autogen.sh: avoid using the '-path' primary to find(1) as it's an
	  extension to posix.2 and is not supported on some operating
	  systems such as solaris.  Now we can autogen.sh on solaris 9.

	* include/defines.h (s_log_message): Added macro for message logging.
	
	* noweb/s_log.nw: Rewritten to use GLib's message logging.

2005-02-19  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * configure.ac, include/funcs.h, include/libgeda.h,

2005-02-18 22:26  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* noweb/g_rc.nw: remove a static declaration to match prototype in
	  prototype.h

2005-02-17 20:00  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/libgeda.nw: Reverted to putenv after
	W. Hoch had problems with compiling g_setenv.

2005-02-14 22:32  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: fix a couple of format string not
	  matching # of arguments bugs

2005-02-14 22:32  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* noweb/f_basic.nw: remove an unused variable

2005-02-14 22:31  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* noweb/s_clib.nw: add some missing config.h inclusions

2005-02-14 22:30  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: fix a "/* in a comment" warning

2005-02-14 22:29  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* include/prototype.h: change prototypes in public header file to
	  not be static

2005-02-14 02:17  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* include/defines.h, noweb/g_basic.nw, noweb/g_smob.nw: put back
	  scm_makfrom0str().  It is scm_makfromstr() which was deprecated,
	  scm_makfrom0str() is still ok.  Suggested by Patrick Bernaud.

2005-02-13  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/s_page.nw (s_page_init_list): Removed useless initialization 
	of page head fields.

	* docs/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, noweb/Makefile.am: 
	* docs/libgedadoc.texi: Updated after removal of s_scratch.

	* noweb/s_scratch.nw: Removed.

2005-02-13 01:38  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* include/prototype.h, noweb/s_slib.nw: fix up const usage to be
	  consistant.  Gets rid of several gcc warnings.

2005-02-11  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/libgeda.nw, s_hierarchy.nw: Adapted for 
	changes in toplevel and page APIs and function set_window.

	* noweb/m_basic.nw (set_window): New prototype: added pointer on page
	to work on as second parameter.
	
	* noweb/s_page.nw: Simplified API and refactoring.

	* src/Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.am, noweb/Makefile.am: Modified for 
	addition of s_toplevel.nw and deletion of s_project.nw.
	
	* docs/libgedadoc.texi: Changed references to s_project in s_toplevel.
	
	* noweb/s_toplevel.nw: New file for handling of toplevel structures.

	* noweb/s_project.nw: Removed: replaced by s_toplevel.nw.
	
	* include/struct.h: Modified cwd field of toplevel for dynamic memory 
	allocation.

2005-02-08 22:26  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* include/defines.h, noweb/g_basic.nw, noweb/g_smob.nw: replace
	  deprecated guile functions with approved guile-1.6.6 ones

2005-02-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* include/prototype.h:
	* noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/g_smob.nw, noweb/i_vars.nw:
	* noweb/libgeda.nw, noweb/o_attrib.nw, noweb/s_color.nw:
	* noweb/s_log.nw, noweb/s_menu.nw, noweb/s_page.nw:
	* noweb/s_undo.nw, noweb/u_basic.nw: Deleted functions u_basic_strdup() 
	and u_basic_strdup_multiple(): use GLib functions instead.

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw, noweb/o_text_basic.nw:
	* noweb/s_log.nw, noweb/s_page.nw, noweb/s_slib.nw:
	* include/defines.h: Deleted *_SEPARATER_* macros: now rely on GLib 
	for the determination of the directory separator.

	  noweb/f_image.nw, noweb/f_print.nw, noweb/g_basic.nw,
	  noweb/o_image.nw, noweb/s_project.nw: - lots of clean up of

	  const.  Mostly this involved adding lots of	missing const's.  -
	  also add a few missing prototypes and header files.  - fix call
	  to realpath (it was being given a pointer to a pointer rather
	  than a pointer).

2005-02-03 03:54  danmc

	* include/prototype.h: add missing s_project_alloc prototype

2005-02-01  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/*.nw:
	* include/libgeda.h: Changed the includes of gh.h in include of 
	libguile.h required by the scm interface of guile.
	
	* noweb/g_basic.nw, noweb/g_rc.nw:
	* noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/g_smob.nw: Switched to the new scm 
	interface of guile.

2005-01-31  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/g_rc.nw: Fixed the escaping in format strings of messages.

2005-01-30  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/g_rc.nw: Code cleanup: added guile assertions, fixed some 
	memory problems, make it use more of glib.

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw (o_complex_read): Fixed test after library 
	search to avoid crash when the component is not found.

2005-01-29  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Adapted for new component 
	library code.

	* noweb/s_clib.nw: Rewrote code for component library.

2005-01-28 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/s_page.nw, 
	noweb/s_project.nw: incorporated patch by Patrick Bernaud.
	
2005-01-27 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, noweb/f_basic.nw,
	noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/s_page.nw, noweb/s_project.nw,
	noweb/u_basic.nw:  Changes made to enable correct opening
	of schematics in foreign directories.  New algorithm:
	
        1.  Take the filename the user wants to open.
        2.  Turn it into an absolute path, like /foo/bar/baz.sch
        3.  From the path, figure out the directory, /foo/bar
        4.  From this, create the absolute path to the local gafrc, 
	    /foo/bar/gafrc.
        5.  cd to /foo/bar
        6.  read /foo/bar/gafrc while sitting in the directory /foo/bar.  
	    This takes care of all the guile search path problems, 
	    like when people put things like 
	    (component-library "../common/symlib") or some such into
            their RC files.
        7.  After that, read the file itself.
        8.  Leave the directory set to this directory.  
	
2005-01-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Fixed a bug where sometimes 
	missing rotated/mirror components will cause gschem to render the
	"missing component symbol" out in la la land.

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Changed the appearance of the hazard
	triangle to look a little better (angles rounded).  Suggestion by
	Patrick.

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Fixed another bug in the handling of symversion=.
	If the component was the last one in the file and had no attributes,
	then it was not getting checked.

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Further expanded when the placed
	holder component is created in o_complex_add(): when the component
	filename cannot be found.  This hopefully fixes the bug that
	Peter reported: 1) running gschem file.sch, 2) renaming
	a symbol, 3) doing a page revert 4) place holder not being shown.

2005-01-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/defines.h, noweb/a_basic.nw, f_image.nw, f_print.nw,
	o_attrib.nw, o_basic.nw, o_complex_basic.nw, o_list.nw, o_selection.nw,
	s_basic.nw, s_clib.nw, s_conn.nw, s_cue.nw:  Slightly refactored
	and rearranged Stuart's OBJ_PLACEHOLDER code to make it a first
	class object within libgeda.  Added a graphical representation and
	a few bits of code here and there to make it manipulatable in gschem.

2005-01-22  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	* noweb/prototype.h, noweb/s_scratch.nw: Added function
	s_scratch_non_unique_string_fill. This can enable gnetlist
        to return a non-unique list of packages.
        In order to don't duplicate code, s_scratch_string_fill
        function now checks if the string is unique and calls
        s_scratch_non_unique_string_fill.

2005-01-19 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>	
	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw, include/o_types.h: Created 
	OBJ_PLACEHOLDER to signal a complex found with no
	symbol file.  Changed o_complex_read to put this
	placeholder into object_list instead of nuking complex.
	This is to mitigate problem where components were being
	removed if sym files weren't found.

2005-01-15 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>	
	* noweb/s_log.nw, prototype.h: changed s_log_init 
	to take const char as arg since it's always called 
	with a quoted string.

2005-01-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Fixed the symbol version checking code to
        handle the case when no attribute are attached to component.  The
        symbol version wasn't being checked in this case in the past.

2005-01-07  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/s_project.nw (s_project_setup_rest): Made it handle
	initialization of field current_clib.

	* include/struct.h: Changed field current_clib of st_toplevel to 
	char*.

	* noweb/s_clib.nw (s_clib_getfiles): Modified prototype and
	simplified code: now returns a list of filenames to avoid
	limitation on number of files in directory.

2005-01-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* noweb/o_basic.nw (o_set_line_options): Moved in this function some 
	error checking and correcting that previously was in gschem code.

2005-01-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/struct.h, noweb/s_project.nw, noweb/f_print.nw: Implemented
	a threshold which controls when postscript outputted text is rendered
	using the vector font instead of the postscript font.  This is a 
	work around for the rather inaccurate multi-line postscript output.

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228, update shared library
	version to 22

2004-07-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/struct.h: Added major_changed_refdes GList to toplevel 
	structure.

	* include/prototype.h: Added new function prototype for:
	o_complex_check_symversion 

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Added some code to make the call to 
	o_complex_check_symversion when a symbol has been read from disk.

	* noweb/s_project.nw: Misc init code

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Added code to implement 
	o_complex_check_symversion which is called whenever a symbol is
	loaded from disk.  This function goes through and searches for
	the symversion= attribute both inside the symbol and attached to
	the instanciated symbol and checks to make sure nothing/something
	has changed.

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Rearranged o_complex_is_eligible_attribute 
	a little to make it easier to force certain attributes (like the 
	new symversion= attribute) to be always promoted (even if they are
	invisible).   Misc whitespace cleanup too.

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Fixed a few spelling mistakes and
	changed version checking so that minor changes are not checked if
	there are major changes.

2004-07-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Added code to specify the rc directory via
	--with-rcdir.  Also set GEDARCDIR for the newly added rc code.

	* include/Makefile.am, papersizes.h, libgeda.h: Added papersizes.h 
	from gschem.

	* include/prototypes.h: Added a whole slew of new function
	prototypes for the new g_rc_* functions.

	* src/Makefile.am, noweb/Makefile.am, noweb/g_register.nw,
	g_rc.nw, i_vars.nw, include/i_vars.h: Moved a whole bunch of rc code
	into libgeda from the various programs.  It is now possible to
	write libgeda dependent programs without having to duplicate a lot
	of rc code.

	* noweb/libgeda.nw: Added a bunch of init routines which the
	individual programs were calling into libgeda_init().

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040710 and changed shared library
	version to 21:0:0
	
2004-05-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_bus_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw, s_cue.nw: Fixed the multi
	colored dot postscript problem reported by Gabriel Paubert.  Removed
	some completely redundant postscript to set the color in the wrong 
	spot.

2004-01-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * config.h.in: Remove machine generated file.

2004-01-11 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040111

	* noweb/o_arc_basic.nw o_attrib.nw o_box_basic.nw o_bus_basic.nw 
	o_circle_basic.nw o_line_basic.nw o_pin_basic.nw o_text_basic.nw:
	Fixed most -Wall warnings.

	* include/prototype.h: Added missing function (caught by -Wall
	in gschem)

	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Had to remove the pin whichend reset
	I added on 2003-12-22, since it broke the auto pin whichend 
	code (o_pin_update_whichend; which relies on whichend equaling -1
	when the whichend is unknown).  Fix the whichend for embedded
	components still needs to be dealt/fixed.  This problem needs a 
	release note.

2004-01-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Fixed the postscript printing of text
	when it is rotated 180 degrees.  

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Attempted to get the multi line text
	printing a little more accurate.  Not quite there, still have a 
	large error when the text consists of many lines.  Work in 
	progress.

	* include/defines.h: Changes LINE_SPACING to be a float.

2004-01-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Applied a patch by Carlos for the new
	spanish characters he contributed.

2003-12-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Fixed a really nasty bug which only
	appeared when using glib 1.2.x.  Appearently g_strsplit() does
	not split strings under glib 1.2.x vs glib 2.2.x in the same way.
	Put back some old code which works properly when using glib 1.2.x.
	Bug identified by Stuart.  Thanks!

	* include/prototype.h: Added missing function prototypes.

	* configure.ac: Bumped version to 20031231

2003-12-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw, include/struct.h: Added displayed_width
	and displayed_height variables to the st_text structure.  These
	variables represent the actual width and height of the displayed
	string.  This info is needed when drawing the quick text rectangles.

2003-12-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added multi line text postscript output.
	It works mostly, but there are still some unexplained
	inaccuracies.

	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Further refined the fix to the embedded
	pins not having the right whichone set.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Partially applied a UTF patch by Carlos.
	This patch started adding unicode support to the internal font
	table.  Since I cannot test this change right now, I have decided
	to not apply this patch completely.  I did apply all the 1.5 to 2
	changes as well as the memory leak plug.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Included in the above patch was the
	change to make the multi line spacing 2 instead of 1.5.  I made
	this line spacing parameter a #define (in defines.h) to make 
	changing it easier.  Eventually this will have to become a rc files
	parameter.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Applied another patch by Carlos to remove
	the restriction that attributes cannot be multi line text objects.

2003-12-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: In search of the "why aren't pins which are 
	part of embedded components not connecting" bug, discovered
	that if an older schematic is read (with embedded components),
	the whichone variable wasn't being reset properly (missing <= ).

2003-11-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/struct.h, noweb/s_project.nw: Added unnamed_netname 
	variable to TOPLEVEL (and initialized to NULL).  This is for
	gnetlist.

2003-11-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* config.guess config.sub depcomp install-sh ltmain.sh missing
	mkinstalldirs: Removed machine generated files from CVS

        * Makefile.am: Added the above files to be cleaned during 
        maintainer-clean

	* autogen.sh: Added script to create auto* generated files

2003-10-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added some code to make sure that the
	TAB_CHAR_MODEL character is loaded (via o_text_load_font) before
	its text_size is used.

2003-10-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/defines.h: Applied Carlos' latest tab improvement patch.
	Added TAB_CHAR_MODEL as a #define.  TAB_CHAR_MODEL defines what
	character is used to decide how big the single space in the tab
	character is.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Also part of  Carlos' latest tab
	improvement patch.  Calculated the spacing for a tab using the
	TAB_CHAR_MODEL and adding an offset.

2003-10-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* a_basic.nw, g_smob.nw, m_basic.nw, o_arc_basic.nw, o_attrib.nw,
	o_box_basic.nw, o_bus_basic.nw, o_circle_basic.nw, o_complex_basic.nw,
	o_line_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw, o_pin_basic.nw, o_text_basic.nw,
	s_basic.nw, s_slib.nw: Applied Carlos Nieves Onega's multi-line text
	patch.	Thank you Carlos!  The next items are the all changes from
	Carlos' patch and my integration changes.  The changes happened
	over a period of a few weeks, but were checked in on the above
	date.

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Removed fixed size buffer from o_save_embedded() 
	and o_save().  Also changed the function signature (removed buf)
	of all o_*_save functions.

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Changed call to o_text_read to take file pointer.
	string(s) is now read inside o_text_read().

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Removed old string[...] variable.

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Added missing free() in o_save_embedded().

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Simplified the update sym/sch message

	* noweb/g_smob.nw: Fixed up call to o_attrib_get_name_value (which
	now it's own memory allocation of the parameters).

	* noweb/g_smob.nw: Added if's around free's since
	o_attrib_get_name_value can return null in certain cases.

	* noweb/m_basic.nw: Removed unnecessary calculation from
	set_window()

	* noweb/o_arc_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_arc_save to just
	take an object pointer.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer in
	o_read_attribs.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Changed o_save_attribs to call new signature
	save functions.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Changed o_attrib_get_name_value to return
	allocated character buffers (instead of having to pre-allocate
	them).  This change had significant impact on lots of other code.
	If instability occurs, then look at all instances of
	o_attrib_get_name_value to make sure memory is allocated properly
	and freed.  Name and value must be freed eventually.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: o_attrib_get_name_value() was rewritten to 
	use g_strsplit to break up the string into name and value.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: o_attrib_search_name(),
	o_attrib_search_string_partial(), o_attrib_search_attrib_value(),
	o_attrib_search_attrib_name(), o_attrib_search_toplevel(),
	o_attrib_search_name_single(), o_attrib_search_name_single_count():
	All modified to use the newly changed o_attrib_get_name_value().

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a bunch of frees in certain places to
	prevent memory leaks.   

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Rearranged o_attrib_get_name_value() so that
	a memory leak does not occur (check the input up front as possible
	before splitting the attribute)

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added extra checks to prevent possible core
	dumps.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Removed an extra malloc which was causing a
	memory leak.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Changed the "Found an improper attribute: ..."
	message to be logged to the log file instead of stderr.

	* noweb/o_box_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_box_save to just
	take an object pointer.

	* noweb/o_bus_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_bus_save to just
	take an object pointer.

	* noweb/o_circle_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_circle_save to just
	take an object pointer.

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer
	from: o_complex_add(), o_complex_read(), o_complex_save().
	Changed signature of o_complex_save to just take an object pointer.

	remove_last_nl().

	* noweb/s_slib.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added o_text_num_lines()

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: In o_text_load_font removed fixed size 
	character buffer.  Added code to set the width of the new line
	character (a nop really) and set the width of characters that 
	cannot be identified.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Rewrote o_text_height() and
	o_text_width() to handle multiple line text objects.  o_text_height
	takes the input string (since it can be multiple lines long) as
	a parameter now.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Removed a size adjustment hack when
	calculating the width of a string. 

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added code to o_text_create_string to
	handle multi-line text objects.  Also added code to handle

	to o_attrib_get_name_value to use the new function signature.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Changed o_text_read() to take the file
	pointer as an argument.  This function now reads in the multiple
	lines of text.  Added code to handle the reading in of multi-line
	text items when the file format is 1.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added log message when using gtk+ 1.2.x and
	a multi-line text item is read in.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: In o_text_set_info_font(), added code to
	set the width of the special newline character correctly.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added code to set the text width of 
	character not found (loaded the ? char instead)

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_net_save to just
	take an object pointer.  Changed file format to save the number
	of lines in the text item.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: In o_text_recreate(), o_text_print(),
	o_text_mirror_old(), fixed the usage of o_attrib_get_name_value().

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Removed the w_current parameter from
	o_text_height() since it is not used.

	* noweb/g_smob.nw, o_attrib.nw, o_text_basic.nw: Added some checks
	to make sure valid pointers are freed (everywhere 
	o_attrib_get_name_value) is called.

	* noweb/*.nw: misc code format cleanup

	* include/prototype.h: Changed string to file pointer to
	o_text_read()

	* include/defines.h: Added #define for max single line length.  
	The text line can spawn multiple 1024 length lines, but a single
	line can only be 1024 characters long.

	* include/globals.h: Added tab_in_chars global variable.
 	
	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Removed old string[...] variable.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added code to make sure that attributes are 
	only a single line.

	* noweb/o_box_basic.nw, noweb/o_circle_basic.nw: Removed all //
	comments (replaced them with C comments) 

2003-10-18 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Updated version to something more recent, but this
	version is not an official release.

2003-10-05 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Oops, misspelled saved_CFLAGS and therefore libgeda
	wasn't being built with -O2 -g which probably caused the code to be
	rather un-optimal.  Fixed.

2003-10-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to something more recent, but this
        version is not an official release.

	* noweb/a_basic.nw, o_arc_basic.nw, o_attrib.nw, o_box_basic.nw, 
	o_bus_basic.nw, o_circle_basic.nw, o_complex_basic.nw, 
	o_line_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw, o_pin_basic.nw, o_text_basic.nw: 
	Added the file format flag to the "v" file line.  Also moved all 
	version numbers into include/define.h.

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Removed fudge factor from width calculation.

	* include/defines.h: Added version numbers, added #define for the
	current file format version (FILEFORMAT_VERSION).

	* include/prototype.h: Updated due to changed loading function
	signatures.

	* configure.ac: Incremented shared library to 20

2003-09-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Fixed MinGW cflags/ldflags

        * auto* files: Updated to autoconf 2.57 and automake 1.7.6

2003-08-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Changed AC_CONFIG_HEADER to AM_CONFIG_HEADER

        * configure.ac: Removed the use of GUILE_PROGS as it is not part
        of guile 1.4.  Put in a manual check for guile-config.

2003-08-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Fixed the test for libgdgeda.  It was failing if
	it was not installed; libgdgeda is optional and should not cause
	a configure to fail.

2003-08-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Improved a bunch of the external library tests for
	gtk+, guile.
	
	* configure.ac: Improved the configuration summary message.

	* configure.ac: Oops forgot to AC_SUBST the LIBTOOL_FLAGS variable,
	shared library was being build with the wrong version
	
	* configure.ac: Added --with-gtk12 flag so that users can force
	libgeda to use gtk+ 1.2 instead of gtk+ 2.2.x (if it is found)

	* configure.ac: Removed gtk+ and the X libraries from LIBGEDA_LDFLAGS
	variable so that programs that don't need gtk+ or X, don't link those
	libraries.  gschem is the only program which should be linking gtk+
	and X.

2003-07-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac and friends: Rewrote the configure scripts to be sane,
	much simpler, and up-to-date.

	* configure.in, acconfig.h, and others: Removed a whole bunch of 
	obsolete files.

	* noweb/o_arc_basic.nw, o_box_basic.nw o_bus_basic.nw 
	o_circle_basic.nw, o_line_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw, o_pin_basic.nw:
	Obsoleted the HAS_LIBGDGEDA2 #define.  libgdgeda 2.0.15 is now
	required.

	* libgeda.pc.in: Added new file which is used with pkg-config.  
	libgeda now requires pkg-config to configure and the other tools will
	need pkg-config to link to libgeda.

	* libgeda-config.in: Remove this file in favor to using pkg-config.

	* Toplevel Makefile: Added PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to
	the help message.  This variable is now required.

	* *.in, *.h, etc: Removed a bunch of old unneeded auto* files.

	* Toplevel Makefile: Changed the libgeda-config-install to 
	libgeda-pc-install (for the libgeda.pc file)

	* Toplevel Makefile: Removed all traces of gesym-config*, since
	this script is no longer used.

	"extents"

2003-02-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/s_clib.nw: Added a little more error checking to 
	s_clib_add_entry().

2003-02-18 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Bumped version to 20030223

	* config.h.in, configure.in, include/libgeda.h, noweb/g_basic.nw:

	* configure.in: Applied Gabriel Paubert's warning reducing patch with
	a few minor mods.

2003-01-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Changed -fnative-struct to -mms-bitfields for
        gcc 3.2 mingw compiler (older mingw compilers are no longer 
        supported)

2003-01-07 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/s_page.nw: Fixed debian Bug#175718: geda-gschem: schematic
	silently discarded by adding code into s_page_save_all().

2002-12-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Fixed a minor typo by applying Egil's latest

2002-12-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* acconfig.h, config.h.in, configure.in.h: Added tests to look for
	the new libgdgeda 2.0.x 

	* noweb/o_arc_basic.nw, o_box_basic.nw, o_bus_basic.nw,
	o_circle_basic.nw, o_line_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw,
	o_pin_basic.nw: Added calls to the gd thickness function to render
	thick lines in the png output
	
	* noweb/s_basic.nw: Initialized a few members of st_object which 
	should have been set to zero.

	patch from Egil Kvaleberg

2002-12-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/struct.h: Added menubar variable to TOPLEVEL
	
2002-11-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * aclocal.m4: Removed file from cvs.

2002-11-04 Egil Kvaleberg       <egil@kvaleberg.no>

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Changed comment for swedish/finnish characters
	since they cause (my version of nowaeve at least) to dump core.

2002-11-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Added code to print out a message when an old
	file is read in.

        * configure.in: Updated version to 20021103 (an official version)

2002-10-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added libgeda-config-install target

	* include/defines.h: Added a bunch of #defines for various widths
	and the visual cues

	* noweb/f_print.nw: Fixed bug: When generating color postscript, 
	the size of the paper wasn't being dealt with at all (wrt to the
	background fill).	

	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Changed the hard coded value for pin width
	when outputing postscript to be 1) #defined and 2) properly computed.

	* noweb/o_net_basic.nw: Changed the hard coded value for net width
	when outputing postscript to be 1) #defined and 2) properly computed.

	* noweb/o_bus_basic.nw: Changed the hard coded value for bus width
	when outputing postscript to be 1) #defined and 2) properly computed.

	* noweb/o_arc_basic.nw: Fixed a long standing bug (since July 2002),
	where arc png output would be wrong.  Turns out that the width and
	height of an arc are not always equal.  Bug reported by Karel 
	'Clock' Kulhavy.

	* noweb/s_cues.nw: Changed the hard coded value for all cues sizes
	when outputing postscript to be 1) #defined and 2) properly computed.

	* configure and friends: Ran "autoreconf --force --install -v" 
        to really upgrade to the newest version of the auto* tools.

	* include/struct.h: Added force_boundingbox rc variable.

	* noweb/s_project.nw: Added init code for above variable.

	* noweb/s_pin_basic.nw: Added code that if force_boundingbox variable
	is true, then use the entire bounding box in the pin auto whichend
	calculation (instead of default: just the pins).
	
2002-10-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/struct.h: Added variables for the bus ripper support
	in gschem (to TOPLEVEL structure).

	* include/defines.h: Added #defines for the bus ripper support
	in gschem.

	* noweb/s_basic.nw: Added code to init some of the above added
	variables

	bus_ripper_direction variable when rotating nets.

2002-10-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/struct.h: Added bus_ripper_direction variable to objects.
	Only valid for buses. 

	* include/struct.h: Added st_bus_ripper structure.  Used in the
	auto creation of bus rippers when connecting a net to a bus.

	* noweb/s_cue.nw: Changed code to draw the new smaller circles
	when connecting a net to a bus.

	* noweb/s_conn.nw: Added some restrictions on connections between
	nets / pins and buses.  You cannot connect a pin to a bus period.
	You cannot connect a net to the end of a bus (only to the middle).

	* noweb/s_basic.nw: Init of the bus_ripper_direction variable,
	which holds a value (0 = no connection, -1, or 1) to decide which
	direction the rippers are drawn.

	* noweb/o_line_basic.nw: Added o_line_length (returns the length
	of a line).

	* noweb/o_bus_basic.nw: Added code to the read/save functions to
	read/save the bus_ripper_direction flag to disk.  Also handled old
	versioned files (variable defaults to zero).

	* noweb/s_project.nw: Oops, missed override_bus_color in the init
	of the toplevel variable.  Important since the color of buses was 
	being set to zero by gschlas.

2002-10-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Oops, broke the single pin case.  Added
	code handle this case (basically do the original world bounding
	box if only one pin is found).  Changed function to take this pin
	count as a paramater.

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Passed the number of found pins to 
	o_pin_update_whichend

	* configure.in, *.m4: Upgraded to automake 1.7.1 and autoconf 2.54

2002-10-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>
	
	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Added some error checking for the whichend
	parameter on pins.

	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Changed the get world bounding box call in
	o_pin_update_whichend to only look at pins instead of all
	graphics.  This fixes a bug which Werner Hoch reported.
	
2002-09-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Minor performance tweek wrt the 20020825 
	pin compatiblity referenced below.

2002-09-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a missing termination character to an
	error condition where an invalid attribute is found.  A premptive
	fix for a possible core dump in gschem's multi attribute dialog box.

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 20020922, which is NOT a release.

	* include/struct.h: Added whichend and pin_type to the st_object
	structure.  These are pin specific variables.

	* include/defines.h: Added #defines to support pin_type.  Not in use
	yet.

	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Added o_pin_update_whichend, which figures out
	which end is the active connection end point.  It does not work on
	angled pins.

	* noweb/a_basic.nw: Added a call to o_pin_update_whichend (in 
	o_read) which is called when an old symbol/schematic is read
	in to update the pin's which end variable.  This code is only
	called if a pin is read in.
	
	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Added code to read and write the new file
	pin fields (pin_type and whichend).  libgeda will still read all the
  	old formats just fine.

	* noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Updated o_pin_add to take pin_type and
	whichend as parameters.

	* noweb/s_basic.nw: Inited pin_type and whichend in st_object.	

	* noweb/s_conn.nw: Added code to control which end point of a pin
	can have a connection attached to it.  This is control via the
	whichend variable.  A 0 in whichend is the first end point, while
	a 1 is the second end point.  You can now draw a net through a pin
	and libgeda will only register one connection (at the active end).

2002-09-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/s_project.nw: Added new file.  Basically the s_project.c
	that gnetlist used is now in libgeda.  This will make writing
	utils which read in sch/sym files much easier.

	* src/Makefile.am: Bumped shared library version number to 17.

	* include/funcs.h: Added variable_set_func and quit_func to allow
	user programs to use the new s_project_* code.

2002-08-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/struct.h: Added setpagedevice* rc file variables

	* noweb/f_print.nw: Added the code to implement the
	setpagedevice-* rc keywords.

	* noweb/*.nw: Cleaned up -Wall warnings
	
2002-07-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	uref= which is now deprecated (replaced by refdes=)
	
2002-07-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Fixed the crash when you try to display
	the finnish/swedish characters
	
2002-07-07 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Changed o_complex_return_pin_object()
	to look for things using the pinnumber= attribute (instead of
	pinseq)

	* include/defines.h: Renamed a few #defines to slowly migrate away
	from the word "label"
	
2002-07-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.in/Makefile.am: Upgraded to automake 1.6.2

2002-07-05 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Removed an extra / when reading in
	embedded components

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Removed a log message which is not an error:
	( Did not find slot= attribute )

	* noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Changed o_complex_return_pin_object to 
	search using the pinseq attribute

2002-06-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a o_attrib_print_reverse to help
	in debugging.

	character as a delimiter.
	
2002-06-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/struct.h: Moved all the gsymcheck structures to a
	gsymcheck specific file

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Completely removed two obsolete o_attrib_search_* 
	functions

2002-06-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* noweb/s_basic.nw: Added patch by Bryce Denney to remove \r in 
	remove_nl(...).  This was done to have clean interoperability between
	the unix and win32 ports.  I don't know if the patch is sufficient
	to cleanup component (etc...) lines.  Will have to test this for the
	next release.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: A few misc cleanups in various functions

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added o_attrib_search_string_single to help
	support gnetlist backend fix work.  Takes an object and a complete
	attribute and returns a pointer to the object.

	* noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a null pointer check in
	o_attrib_return_parent(...) 

2002-06-18 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

2001-02-16 Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/o_net_basic.c: Oops, nets which caused midpoints were being
	  consolidated away (bad), fixed this by checking first to make
	  sure that that particular endpoint didn't cause any midpoints
	  (if it did, don't consolidate the net)
	  
2001-02-11 Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_pin_basic.c: Moved the tile update call

2001-02-04 Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/o_complex_basic.c: Added a flag to save the state of
	  ADDING_SEL (bad variable name, it really means that you want to
	  delay doing any s_conn_update_* calls)

	* src/s_conn.c: Changed the *_return* functions to take in a list
	  and then return it

	* src/s_tile.c: Changed update function to return if an invalid
	  v, w tile index was ever calculated (this means that the objects
	  is outside of the tile grid (which is okay mainly for rotation of
	  objects)

	* src/s_page.c: Made sure page_current points to the current page
	  being freed in s_page_free_all

	* src/s_tile.c: Changed s_tile_remove_object to take a page

	* src/s_tile.c: More work on some of the routines to get objects
 	  into the right tiles

          which caused debug output to be included in the build

2000-12-09  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/m_basic.c: Put some code into WORLDtoSCREEN routines to bound
	  coords to +/- 2^15 - 1  This is caused by 1) a less than perfect
	  clipping routine and 2) the fact that X stores coords in signed
	  shorts.   This may effect portability to machines where this isn't
	  the case.   The original manifested itself by an endpoint (zoomed
	  really really close) suddenly drawing itself incorrectly.  The
	  clipping routine I used doesn't handle horizontal lines at all.

	* src/s_nethash.c: Rewrote s_nethash_build to not use the internals
	  of the hash table.  New version uses a *_hash_foreach function.
 	  The original function was poorly written and violated library
	  encapsulation (my bad).

	* src/o_circle.c: Removed unneeded variable

	* configure.in: Added -fnative-struct flag for CYGWIN port only

	* configure.in: Added --enable-debug flag to enable -g flag

	  the objects in a selection list into a plain object list 

	* src/o_list.c: In o_list_copy_all_selection2 unselected the object
	  first (all objects in the selection list should be selected) and
	  then reselected it

	  as attributes as a sch/sym is being read in (o_read_attribs)

	* src/o_attrib.c: Fixed a nasty bug where the color of text was
	  being forced to the attribute color even if you didn't want that
	  color (pointed out by Magnus)

9/19/99 Make sure libgeda works with guile-1.3.2a

	Added some code to o_text.c to look for char_.sym for lowercase
	characters when running CYGWIN32

	Messed up above slightly, now fixed

	Did not return a success (zero) in s_color_request, now fixed

	Increased the number colors to 25

	Fixed all warnings

	Increased the .so version of libgeda to 4

9/18/99	Fixed a bug in s_color_gdcolor_init, had the gd color alloc in the
	wrong place (before a pointer was set)

9/17/99	Added/changed a few variables the various structures in struct.h

9/16/99	Removed the restriction that sym/sch files have to be perfect.  You
	now can have garbage in a sym/sch file and it won't exit, but instead
	warn the user and display what it read in.

	Added a bunch of tests into o_attrib_attach to prevent:
		- Attaching a non-text item as an attribute
		- Attaching an attribute to more than one object
	
	Improved the warning that is displayed when an attribute is already
	attached to an object

	Updated f_open and s_page_new to only open a schematic/symbol if it
	isn't opened already.

9/12/99	Added a flag in s_netlist structure for net naming priority

9/7/99	Added s_color.c 
	
	Cleaned up code to reflect the new function names created by s_color.c

	Removed all lame function pointers now that the color stuff is part
	of libgeda

	Added st_color structure to struct.h

	Added o_attrib_search_name_single_count which is like the other
	search_name functions in that it allows you to pick the n'th 
	occurance of an attribute but only searching the specified in object

9/6/99	Removed most color #defines from color.h, in prep for the new color
	system

	Temporarily broke color postscript printing
	Temporarily broke color image writing

	Put into colors.h the proper #defines for the new colors scheme
	
	Put a few user rc variables into the toplevel struct

	Fixed color postscript printing
	To do this, I had to create a ps_color_string global variable function
	pointer, so every gEDA program needs to define this if it has to be
	linked to libgeda

	Fixed a coredump bug which was caused by improper attributes (ie
	pin15=  (and no value))

	Fixed o_attrib_get_name_value so that improper attributes are NOT
	returned as proper attributes 

	Started to fix the broken color image writing
		- Re-arranged the allocation of colors in o_image.c

	Got color image writing working again

	Unfortunately had to create another function pointer for 
	x_color_gdcolor_init (ugg... I need to clean all this up...)

8/31/99 Renamed ntext to text (finally)

	Hopefully fixed the problem that gnetlist was having with embedded
	components ?

8/30/99	Fixed the bus visual cues postscript output to look better 
	(by controlling the capstyle)

	Fixed the direction of horizontal bus visual cues in postscript
	output

	Renamed all ales to conn and ALES to CONN


8/29/99	Added bus_gc

	Added support to the postscript / image printing for the bus cues

	Got bus to look thicker when they are imaged.  Still need to do
	the same to nets

	Fixed a postscript problem when you have thin nets enabled 
	(everything would be thick... which is the exact opposite of what
	 you would want)

	Removed a "this is totally broken" comment from o_complex_add_embedded
	(I think it works... but just in case...)

	Removed all warnings from the code

8/28/99 Fixed a minor bug: connect two nets to a bus to the same point, you
	would get an invalid cue, which isn't right (that's a valid bus
	midpoint connection).

8/27/99 Set the program version to 19990829 to force Ales to release
        on the 29th :)

	Updated all *.c and *.h files to have the right address for the
        FSF in the copyright/licence header
  
        Updated library so version 

8/18/99	More work getting buses to work correctly, updates to o_ales 
	(which will turn into o_conn eventually)

	Added #defines for output-capstyle
	
	Added code in f_print which does the work of the capstyle keyword 

	More work in o_ales to get bus to work right.
	
	Added code which determines if a connection is valid or invalid
		NOT valid:  pin to bus
		NOT valid:  net to endpoint of bus	
		
8/17/99 Started adding bus object
		Including creation of all basic functions
		Update toplevel structure (struct.h)
		Update of enumerated types of objects 

8/12/99	Added o_net_modify to support the stretch command

8/11/99 Added o_attrib_search_toplevel which searches for toplevel attributes
	in all loaded pages.

	Fixed a fatal bug (core dump) in the o_net_consolidate_lowlevel
	function (as well as a possible memory leak) that deal with
	connecting nets together which both had attributes.

	Fixed another memory leak in o_net_consolidate_*

	Fixed configure.in to properly check for cygwin port and X11
	libraries (for all other tools as well)

8/5/99  Added some stuff to configure.in for win32 builds

	Removed some bogus #includes <dirent.h> from a bunch of files
	s_attrib.c, s_papersize.c, s_stroke.c

	Renamed private POINT structure to sPOINT (single POINT) in m_basic.c
	(it was conflicting with some includes in win32)

	Added some more #if conditions to the #include <direct.h>, only
	include this on UNIX platforms

	Added code in configure.in to ignore the requirement for X11 for
	cygwin

8/3/99	Added to TOPLEVEL the net_consolidate flag

	Upgraded to libtool 1.3.3

	First attempt at getting net_consolidate to work with attached
	attributes

	Removed an extra return from o_attrib.c

	net-consolidate code is not 100% working today.

7/27/99 Added o_net_consolidate* functions which take net segments and 
	if possible combine the nets into one single net.

	Added o_net_consolidate to f_open so that it runs
	whenever you open a schematic

	Added o_net_consolidate to f_save so that it runs 
	whenever you save a schematic

7/25/99 Cleaned up g_read_file(). (by Kazu Hirata)
	
7/23/99 Added u_basic_strdup_multiple() to u_basic.c. (by Kazu Hirata)

7/21/99 More work on getting all objects to use new object init and link
	routines (rest of o_*_basic.c functions) 

	Created u_basic.c for utitlity functions to which Kazu is adding

	Removed all traces of s_passing.c and s_passing.h (Yeah, no more
	p_* kludge)

	#if 0'ed out add_object, replaced by new object init and link 
	routines

	Found all unknown p_* variables and removed them

7/16/99 Added s_basic_init_object which just creates an object and inits
	it with default values (this is part of the s_passing kludge removal)

	Added s_basic_link_object which links in the object into the passed in
	ptr linked list.

	Removed "int selected" from struct.h (was totally unused)

	Minor cosmetic changes in struct.h

	As a first test, converted o_ntext_basic.c to use new 
	s_basic_init_object and s_basic_link_object

7/15/99 Added support for libgdgeda 1.6 (mainly means searching for libpng)

	Removed all traces of old libgdgeda 1.5 gif support

	Changed the check for zlib (uncompress is the function it searches
	for)

7/10/99 Started to improve the performance of the math functions
	(was doing to much math everytime I was calling pix_x/pix_y)

	Finished speed improvements in mil_x and mil_y

	Updated a few places where it's important to call set_window
        (part of the math speed improvements)

	Added some variables to struct.h to support gschem rc files

	Added displayed_text_len which holds the true string length of 
	text which is displayed

	Added a check in o_ntext_read for unsupported text angles

7/6/99  Didn't really disable libgdgeda when using --disable-gdgeda
        Now fixed.

7/5/99	Fixed a minor typo when allocating a string "pin" instead of "slot"

	of struct.h

	Added code to warn user that a zero length object (line, net, pin 
	etc...) was just read in

7/2/99 	Fixed the ./configure stuff dealing with libgdgeda so that it works
	when libgdgeda isn't installed in a system directory

7/1/99 	Changed all gd includes to gdgeda to distinguish my version of gd
	from the official one

6/26/99 Fixed the output of 180 rotated text in the postscript output

6/25/99 Added the ability to generate black and white gifs

	Moved a o_redraw_all from libgeda into gschem where it belongs
	(f_image.c)

	Removed all traces of GTK_DEVEL 

6/24/99 Got all the object primatives outputing to the image (including
	the rather painful arcs) 

	Added the ability to change the image size

	Added a o_recalc function which recalcs, but doesn't draw the objects

6/23/99 Added o_image.c (which is code which uses the gd lib to output 
	schematics to gifs)

	Added some entries in the TOPLEVEL structure to support the image
	printing

	Added f_print.c which includes all the toplevel code for writing
	an image

	Added support to configure and friends to make libgd an optional
	library

6/17/99 Added o_ales_search_object which goes through entire the ales_table and 
	finds the n'th occurance of object 

	Above may be removed and moved somewhere else (into gnetlist)

6/13/99 Removed s_delete_head from production

	Attempted to find the hidden attribute memory leak

	Found above memory leak and squashed. 

6/10/99 Added the start of support for not creating text items which are 
	hidden

	Put some casts to make make happy (less warnings)

5/31/99 Fixed printing for nets visual cues

	Removed all traces of the old connection system

	Discovered a core dump condition in clib_cache_free
	(caused by reading in swedish/non-standard-ascii character font
	 files, okay for now)

	Few minor touch up to s_clib.c, but not enough to solve above

5/29/99 Change the license for libgeda back to GPL (from LGPL)

	Put in another check in the o_ales_update_nets function to 
	make sure we don't add duplicate objects into the ales_list's

	Added in code which allows for unattached toplevel attributes
	(o_attrib.c)

5/99	See ChangeLog in gschem for all the changes related to the new
	connection stuff

	once things get a big more stable)

5/16/99 Removed ../libgeda/prototype.h from f_print.c

        Removed ../include/x_states.h and ../include/x_events.c

4/15/99	Added coord dialog variables to WINDOW structure

3/23/99 Added GtkWidget *abwindow to struct.h

3/19/99	Added expand_env_variables which takes a string and expands all
	shell enviroment variables. 

	Fixed it so that when you do some attribute related activities
	the changed flag gets set

	Had to remove one of the above because just selecting something 
	with attributes would cause the flag to be set...

3/9/99  Remove all // from all include/*.h files

3/2/99	Added missing #include <stdarg.h> to s_basic.c

3/1/99	Fixed the vsnprintf problem I thought I fixed.  It's fixed now!

	Updated struct.h (new schcheck structure)

2/25/99 Added gsymcheck structures (include/struct.h)

2/12/99 Added code (#ifndef'ed) for vnsprintf to fix the Solaris 5.5.x 
	problem (didn't have vnsprintf).  The vnsprintf wrapper is from 
	Timidity++-1.2.1, which is under the GPL v2.0

	Minor bug fix to s_log_close (disable the logging of messages after
	you close the log file)

	Found a memory leak in s_clib_cache_free, the index used in the loop
        could wrap, so you might end up freeing only a portion of the entries

2/11/99	Searching through stroke structure fixed to be faster (does not 
	search the whole array of structures)

	Implemented a return value of s_stroke_search_execute (TRUE if it
	finds a stroke, FALSE otherwise)

	Increased max number of strokes to 256

2/9/99	Increased buffer which is used for reading in schematics to 1024
	characters

	Increased buffer which is used for saving schematics to 1024
	characters

	Added s_stroke.c (place where strokes to action mapping is stored)

1/24/99 Fixed a fprintf format statement (%% instead of %) in f_print.c

1/23/99 Fixed printing problem created when I switched the rc reading order

	Added code to support portrait printing printing (in struct.h : 
	print_orientation, defines.h - a few useful defines)

	Changed f_print_header, w_current is passed in now 

	Worked some on getting portait mode right (instead of the _hack_ 
	which it currently is)

	Changed the way the translating actual happens in the actual 
	postscript (instead of changing the points in C, it's done with a 
	translate), much cleaner. (be sure to remove all the dead code... 
	maybe?)

	Got portrait printing working more or less.  Still might be buggy
	though.

	Added support for color postscript printing (f_print_set_color)

	Fixed some bugs in the printing of colored nets (end/midpoints not 
	being colored right)

1/17/99 More gtk+ 1.1.x compatibility work (in s_log.c) (minor #ifndef)

	Changed s_log_message to use vsnprintf instead of the g_v* functions
	since they were not behaving like I want them to.

1/9/99	Added gtk+ 1.1.x compatibility to libgeda
		g_vprintf -> g_strdup_vprintf (s_log.c)

12/30/98 Removed duplicate code from snap_grid function

12/15/98 Added clip_nochange and clip_change (really just copied and
	 changed existing code).  These routines either just tell if a 
	 line (object) should be clipped and/or the actual points are 
	 clipped. 

	 Added SCREENencode_halfspace and WORLDencode_halfspace
	 which support above code

	 Discovered that my clipping routine wasn't working completely 
	 right (slope was always zero) fixed now? 

12/13/98 Fixed pin color being saved as -1
	 
	 Added some checks in clip to make sure you don't divide by zero 
	 Assume the object is visible if you were going to divide by zero.

12/9/98 Added WORLDabs and SCREENabs, these function, don't return a points
	coordinates, but rather an absolute measure in either world or screen
	coordinates (such as a width of a line or the radius of a circle)

	Finally fixed o_ntext_print so that you can print out ('s and )'s.
	(should work on all postscript printers correctly)

	Changed the ps of text output so that it uses "show" instead of
	"true charpath fill"

	Cleaned up rest of circlefixme comments left over from yesterday

12/8/98 Added st_circle structure and CIRCLE typedef to include/struct.h

	Started changing o_circle_basic to use new structures above

	Changed s_basic to allocate and free above structures

	Added circle structure to s_passing.c/s_passing.h
	
	Added some if's in add_object for p_line_points and p_circle

	Went through and added p_circle=NULL to all the places that needed it

	Went through and fixed up all prototype errors associated with above
	change

	Discovered a major bug in o_complex_rotate_lowlevel, was trying to
	rotate a circle using a box routine (worked previously since circle/box
	used similar datastructs, now that's changed) 

	Found the same sort of bug as above in o_complex_mirror_lowlevel. 
	(trying to use box routine to mirror a circle)

12/6/98 Found another really long term bug in dist() (wrong value being 
	set to temp var).  I don't know how it worked with this bug.

	Found another long standing bug in circle, again not sure how things
	worked before, dumb luck.  When saving, radius which was saved 
	could have been zero due to how the circle is represented in memory
	(stupidly)

12/5/98 Found a nasty bug in the printing of X endpoint lines, was using
	offset variable instead of cross, also had the wrong variables
	in various places

12/3/98	Added Tom Javen's finnish / swedish libgeda patch to o_ntext_basic.c

11/27/98 Apparently I didn't fix the %! in f_print.c so now it's definately
	 fixed 

11/18/98 Removed some irrelavent/dead/wasteful code from m_basic.c (math 
	 routines)

11/15/98 Added code to center LIMITS printed schematics

	 Added code to deal with space.sym (the right way) (when reading in
	 the width specifier)

	 Added backtick.sym to o_ntext_basic.c

11/6/98 Added sort routine to s_clib_getfiles (so that components are in 
	alphabetical order when displayed)

	Added support to TOPLEVEL struct for print dialog box

	Added s_papersizes.c, place to hold paper sizes read from rc file

	Added print_output_type to TOPLEVEL structure 

11/5/98	Added paper_width, paper_height to the TOPLEVEL structure

	Started work on generalizing the postscript printing (print to
	any papersize)

	Started work on being able to print out the current window

10/28/98 Cleaned up o_ntext_basic to get rid of special code for space 
	 character

10/25/98 Cleaned up all warnings (-Wall only)

	 Added some error checking in a few misc places

	 Added version information to o_save (o_save_write_header)

	 Added version information reading to o_read 
	
	 Passed version info to all o_*_read functions (this was done so, 
	 because o_read is called recursively)

10/24/98 Added the ability to have comments in schematic files, but they are

10/22/98 Removed arc bounding code again... still not working right

	 Added o_attrib_slot_update (update pins based on slot, given complex)

	 Added o_attrib_search_slot_number (search for slot#)

	 Added o_attrib_search_pin_number (search for pin#)
	
	 Added o_attrib_slot_copy (copy pin information over to new complex)

	 Added the o_attrib_slot_copy to o_complex_copy

	 Found a memory leak in the above code, fixed (along with some other
	 major/minor bugs)

	 Got the first working version of the slotting done

10/18/98 Added o_attrib_search_slot 

	 Changed o_attrib_search_name_single to return the object where the
	 attribute lives

	 Added a bunch of o_attrib_search_name_* function to search for
	 various standard attributes

10/17/98 Applied patch by Roger to add variable grid spacing

10/15/98 Attempt to fix the arc bounding code (doesn't quite work 100%)

10/12/98 Found a small bug in world_get_circle_bounds which was causing 
	 a_zoom_limits to set the wrong value if a circle was the largest 
	 object 

	 Finally fixed o_arc_add so that it takes world coords like all
	 the other objects! Woo Hoo!

10/10/98 Added netlist structures to struct.h 

	 Added visited flag to object structure

10/9/98 Removed some really old #if 0 and did a small amount of code cleanup

10/8/98 Worked some more on the mirror code of complex objects

	Almost working except for text inside components which is unmirrored 
	(that displays incorrectly)

10/6/98 Broke schematic format again with the addition of the mirror flag
	on complex objects

	Added code to implement above

	Changed the way the rotating of complex is done

10/5/98 Added o_line_mirror

	Found a nasty cpu sucker, in o_ntext_rotate, where you were doing
	the rotate effectively twice.  Oops.  Removed one line rotate while
	loop

	Added rest of o_*_mirror

	Worked on o_ntext_mirror 

	Worked on o_complex_mirror

	Added all o_*_mirror_world

	Found/fixed a minor bug in the text rotate dealing with the mirror of
	attributes (mirroring wrong point when mirroring attributes)

	Discovered a case which broke arc printing (negative sweep angles),
	Hacked something together to fix it, but unknown if it's a complete
	solution

	Figured out how to finish up complex mirrors, but that will have
	to wait till tomorrow.

10/4/98 Worked on gettting printing working and flexible (f_print)

	Got text to be printed using native postscript fonts.  The mapping
	between the stroked fonts and the real ones is really close, not 
	perfect, but close.

10/1/98 Fixed all warnings (with -Wall)

	Found a place where temp_parent wasn't being used to temporarly
	hold object_parent (o_list.c _copy_all)

	Added README and COPYING

9/30/98	Added code to have text that is rotate 180 degrees be upright and
	readable (almost perfect, but still need to get it exactly looking
	right) (text with bars and text with subscripts doesn't rotate right,
	but that can be fixed in a better way)

9/29/98 Today starts the new release system: 19980929

	Added o_attrib_copy_all (to copy attribute lists), useful when you 
	rotate components (and the attribute list is discarded)

	Added o_attrib_reattach and o_attrib_set_color to help support the
	proper continuation of attached attributes to complexes when they 
	are rotated

0.0.5
-------
9/27/98 Fixed o_complex_*_rotate functions to actually work
	Modelled after the ntext ones

	Found a rotate bug in arc_world if you passed in a zero angle
	Made a similar change to all the rotate_world functions

	Found a new bug in arc_rotate_world, arc's were not being rotated
	correctly

	Moved the highly gschem specific o_complex_rotate into gschem/

	Fixed the broken x_update_log call in s_log_message

9/26/98 Added o_*_rotate_world routines  

	More attempts at getting complex's to read and rotate in correctly

	Added o_ntext_rotate_lowlevel (which properly rotates text 
	based on angle)

	Fixed rotate_point_90 so that it can accept any angle in increments
	of 90 degrees.

	Wrote and Got o_ntext_rotate working (which rotates text when you
	hit the rotate button)

9/25/98 Added the angle argument to the complex type (this breaks all 
	schematic files!!) (embedded components now totally broken)

9/23/98	Fixed snap_grid, so that it would work on negative inputs (doh!)

	Added rotate_point_90, a simplied more general func of rotate_point
	Might be removed in the future, but for now is guaranteed to work.

	Fixed o_line_rotate (better name) and to use above function

	Added all the o_*_rotate functions, most stubbed, only ones that work
	are the line related ones

9/17/98 New code for snapping to the grid (m_basic.c)

9/13/98	Added scheme_directory to the TOPLEVEL structure 

9/12/98 Added return_zoom_number (m_basic.c)

	Added world_get_complex_bounds (o_complex_basic.c)

	Added o_complex_world_translate_toplevel (for object like components)
	which should be completely translated (o_complex_basic.c)

	Added world_get_ntext_bounds (o_ntext_basic.c)

	Fixed a bug in o_ntext_add where the bounding box of the text item
	was not being set (incorrect call to get_ntext_bounds)

	Fixed a bug in the translate_all deal with complex objects, wrong
	complex translate was being called (should have been _toplevel)

9/4/98	Switched to -version-info since it's more portable 
	
	Moved o_basic (mostly) out of libgeda and into gschem

	Removed a lot of gschem specific functions out of libgeda

	Made some function pointers so that various functions can be 
	revectored (very useful) 

9/3/98	Create libgeda using libtool

	Forced library name to use -release instead of -version-info
	because library will change drastically for a while

	Started work on breaking (removing specifics) libgeda from gschem
