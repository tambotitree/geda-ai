Here's what the prefix letters mean:

        a_ : Action (this was a really poor choice, and will be removed)
        g_ : Guile related functions
        i_ : Interface related functions
        o_ : graphic Object related functions
        x_ : X related functions
        f_ : File related functions
        m_ : Math related functions
        s_ : data Structure related functions

        I've tried to keep the function names in the files correct, but
        sometimes I failed.  (look at libgeda/a_basic.c for an example of
        a file which has a bunch of functions which shouldn't be in there)
