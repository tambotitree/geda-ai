- Examples

	gTAG -  USB to JTAG interface
	-----------------------------
	Author: Stefan Petersen 
	Copyright (C) 2001-2003 Stefan Petersen
	License: GPL
	gTAG is an interface to connect your USB port of computer to talk
	to your circuits which talks JTAG.

	See gTAG/README and gTAG/ChangeLog for more information.
	
	gTAG shows off how to do hierarchical schematics in gEDA/gaf.


	lightning_detector - A lightning detector
	-----------------------------
	Author: Terry Porter
	Copyright (C) 2003 Terry Porter
	License: GPL
	This unit flashes a lamp, the brightness proportional to the
	range/power of lightning.

	lightning detector shows off how to use gEDA/gaf and PCB.
	Also includes the start of a bom creator which reads sch files
	directly.


	RF_Amp - schematics and associated materials for a SPICE model
	of Agilent's MSA-2643 bipolar amp.
	-----------------------------
	Author: Stuart Brorson
	Copyright (C) 2003 Stuart Brorson

	This project exemplifies construction of a hierarchical SPICE
	simulation using gEDA.  You may have edit some paths to get the
	examples to netlist.


	TwoStageAmp - A Two stage amplifier SPICE playpen
	-----------------------------
	Author: Stuart Brorson
	Copyright (C) 2003 Stuart Brorson

	This example shows how to do gEDA SPICE netlisting with SPICE
	models, includes, and directives.  You may have edit some paths
	to get the examples to netlist.
