# The Windows platform has a native gcc port (MinGW) and a
# POSIX compliant one (Cygwin). Both need specific flags to
# build correctly.
#
# The rules are:
#
# On all Windows platforms, pass -no-undefined to libtool.
# This allows shared libraries (DLLs) to be built.
#  
# On MinGW, use the -mms-bitfields compiler flag.
# This increases compatibility with the MSVC compiler.
#
# On MinGW, pass -mwindows when linking GUI-only applications.
# This avoids opening a text console when running from a shortcut.
