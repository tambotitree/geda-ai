The online part of the DRC is that part that is active during normal design activities. It does things like preventing you from drawing traces too close together.

<div class="level3">

<p>
One of the primary hurdles with implementing multi-clearance DRC, or, different DRC requirements for different traces or nets, is the way in which our DRC is implemented. Presently we use an algorithm that bloats or shrinks the objects we&#039;re testing, and looks for changes in connectivity. In a multi-clearance DRC environment, the amount that you would need to bloat your object now depends on the objects around it, which may not have been discovered yet.
