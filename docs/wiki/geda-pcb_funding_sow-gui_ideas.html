Currently, we either enable or disable categories of objects (like vias).  Perhaps an intermediate
setting that either outlines it or draws is translucently, so that things below it can be selected
while still being able to see and interact with the above things?  Example: with rubberband set,
you&#039;d still want to be able to snap to the line endings beneath it, yet move the via along with the
lines.

When you hover over a track, the netname should be displayed in the status line.
