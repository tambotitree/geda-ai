<h1 class="sectionedit1" id="file_format_translation">File format translation</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
We need a universal translator system that can translate in all directions between gEDA tools, possible future gEDA tools, and outside tools that are likely to be used with gEDA tools.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT1 SECTION "File format translation" [121-345] -->
<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="scope">Scope</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Of course, everything to everything is not reasonable.  So, set a limit of gEDA tools, possible future gEDA tools, and outside tools that are likely to be used with gEDA tools.  Of course, tool formats where translation doesn&#039;t make sense don&#039;t need to be supported.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to have an intermediate format.  First translate to the intermediate format, then translate out.  The intermediate format should be sufficiently expressive that there can be a lossless round trip from any gEDA tool format to the intermediate format and back.
</p>

<p>
Lossless means that the resultant file is equivalent in how it works.  It is not necessary to preserve formatting and other things that don&#039;t matter.
</p>

<p>
All of the formats needing translation presently consist of lists of objects, with some kind of encapsulation.  Each object has connections and attributes.
</p>

<p>
This suggests the possible of a standard netlist format as the intermediate format.
</p>

<p>
Further discussion related only to formats that fit this model.
</p>

<p>
If possible, the format chosen should have a history of use for at least part of this, and have a published specification that is externally controlled and freely available.
</p>

<p>
There needs to be a way to merge changes from any target/source without messing up other parts.

All of these consist of lists of objects, with connections and attributes.
</p>

<p>
It is tradition that a netlist is used for interchange, but the traditional approach only goes one way, because information is lost in the translation.
</p>

<p>
The format must convey the meaning, not necessarily in the same way as the tool&#039;s native format or internal storage.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to translate parts that are usually in libraries, and are tool specific, such as models, symbols, or footprints.
</p>

<p>
All contenders for possible formats must support a loss round-trip to any other.

<p>
A popular netlist format.  It has a history of use for interchange, but not yet for physical placement.  Problems: irregular syntax, not sufficiently expressive.  These problems have been a major hassle for years for developers.  It is well accepted, but not by people who know it well.
</p>

<h4 id="verilog">Verilog</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
The structural subset is a good netlist format.  It is regular, sufficiently expressive, and has a published standard.  It has a history of use for interchange, but not yet for physical placement.

<div class="level4">

<p>
The structural subset is a good netlist format.  It is regular, sufficiently expressive, but belongs to one company (Cadence), so rule it out.  It has a history of use for simulation only.

<h4 id="xml">XML</h4>

<p>
XML is not really a format but a syntax.  A good format can easily be made based on XML, but has no history of use in a similar context.  The syntax is well documented but there is no outside documentation of application in any related use.

<p>
Choosing the Verilog format as one possibility.
</p>

<p>
The unit of encapsulation is the “module”:
</p>
<pre class="code">module my-module(connections);
// contents
endmodule</pre>

<p>
Each object in the list has a consistent syntax:
</p>
<pre class="code">type #(attributes) name (connections);</pre>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<pre class="code">resistor #(.r(1k)) r123 (a, b);
resistor #(.r(1k)) r234 (.p(b), .n(c));</pre>

<p>
“r” is the name of an attribute.  “1k” is the value (a string).
</p>

<p>
In the first example, connections are determined by order.  In the second, they are mapped by name.  Node “b” connects to pin “p” and node “c” connects to pin “n”.
</p>

<p>
A “net” is also an object.
</p>

<p>
In the above example, both connect to node b directly.  In a schematic representation the connection would not be direct, but through a “net”
</p>
<pre class="code">resistor #(.r(1k)) r123 (.p(a1), .n(b1));
resistor #(.r(1k)) r125 (.p(b2), .n(c2));
net b (.1(b1), .2(b2));</pre>

<p>
The name of the net is “b”.  It has no attributes.
</p>

<p>
For schematic, you can now place the nodes:
</p>
<pre class="code">place #(.x(1222), .y(3438)) place11333 (b1);
place #(.x(4334), .y(8433)) place34894 (b2);
place #(.x(9393), .y(4232)) place49334 (a1);
place #(.x(2932), .y(2384)) place34983 (c2);</pre>

<p>
Portions that apply in only certain contexts can be selectively included with &#039;ifdef:
</p>
<pre class="code">module my_circuit;
  `ifdef SCHEMATIC
    place ...
    place ...
  `endif
   res ...
   res ...
   net ...
endmodule</pre>

<p>
Complex nets can be encapsulated:
</p>
<pre class="code">module net23842 (1,2,3);
  net n23482 (1,2);
  net n84333 (2,3);
  `ifdef SCHEMATIC
    place ...
    place ...
    place ...
  `endif
endmodule</pre>
<pre class="code">module net9393 (1,2);
  net #(.color(blue), .thickness(thin)) n38423 (1,2);
endmodule</pre>
