NAME
       iverilog-vpi - Compile front end for VPI modules


SYNOPSIS
       iverilog-vpi [--name=name] sourcefile...


DESCRIPTION
       iverilog-vpi  is	 a tool to simplify the compilation of VPI modules for
       use with Icarus Verilog. It takes on the command line a list  of	 C  or
       C++  source files, and generates as output a linked VPI module. See the
       vvp(1) man page for a description of how the linked module is loaded by
       a simulation.

       The  output  is	named after the first source file. For example, if the
       first source file is named foo.c, the output becomes foo.vpi.


OPTIONS
       iverilog-vpi accepts the following options:

       -llibrary
	       Include the named library in the link of the VPI	 module.  This
	       allows VPI modules to further reference external libraries.


       --name=name
	       Normally,  the  output VPI module will be named after the first
	       source file passed to the command.  This	 flag  sets  the  name
	       (without the .vpi suffix) of the output vpi module.


       --install-dir
	       This flag causes the program to print the install directory for
	       VPI modules, then exit. It is a convenience  for	 makefiles  or
	       automated plug-in installers.


PC-ONLY OPTIONS
       The  PC	port of iverilog-vpi includes two special flags needed to sup-
       port the more intractable development environment. These flags help the
       program locate parts that it needs.


       -mingw=path
	       Tell the program the root of the Mingw compiler tool suite. The
	       vvp runtime is compiled with this compiler,  and	 this  is  the
	       compiler	 that  iverilog-vpi  expects  to  use  to compile your
	       source code. This is normally not needed, and if you do use it,
	       it  is only needed once. The compiler will save the path in the
	       registry for use later.


       -ivl=path
	       Set for the use during compilation the root if the Icarus  Ver-
	       ilog install. This is the place where you installed Icarus Ver-
	       ilog when you ran the installer. This flag is also only	needed
	       once, and the path is stored in the registry for future use.


UNIX-ONLY OPTIONS
       The UNIX version of iverilog-vpi includes additional flags to let Make-
       file gurus peek at the  configuration  of  the  iverilog	 installation.
       This  way,  Makefiles  can  be  written	that handle complex VPI builds
       natively, and without hard-coding values that depend on the system  and
       installation.   If  used	 at  all,  these options must be used one at a
       time, and without any other options or directives.


       --cflags
	       Print the compiler flags (CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS) needed to compile
	       source code destined for a VPI module.


       --ldflags
	       Print the linker flags (LDFLAGS) needed to link a VPI module.


       --ldlibs
	       Print the libraries (LDLIBS) needed to link a VPI module.


       -m32    On  64bit systems that support it (and support vvp32) this flag
	       requests a 32bit	 vpi  binary  instead  of  the	default	 64bit
	       binary.


       Example GNU makefile that takes advantage of these flags:

	   CFLAGS = -Wall -O $(CFLAGS_$@)
	   VPI_CFLAGS := $(shell iverilog-vpi --cflags)
	   CFLAGS_messagev.o = $(VPI_CFLAGS)
	   CFLAGS_fifo.o = $(VPI_CFLAGS)
	   messagev.o fifo.o: transport.h
	   messagev.vpi: messagev.o fifo.o
