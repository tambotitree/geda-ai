Currently, gEDA uses CVS.  CVS is the “original” version control system used for collaborating on open source projects.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, CVS has a number of problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> CVS does not support the concept of patch sets.  That is, it&#039;s very difficult to work out what changes went into CVS together without using dodgy tools like <a href="http://www.cobite.com/cvsps/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.cobite.com/cvsps/" rel="nofollow">cvsps</a>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Merging with CVS is painful, especially when there is keyword expansion brokenness such as the <code>Log</code> keyword.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> CVS doesn&#039;t support renames preserving history.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> The overhead involved in creating and managing a branch in CVS is such that people tend to do one of the following:</div>
<ol>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Don&#039;t bother</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Use another VCS locally, then export patches, then commit patches to CVS.  This is a big hassle for everyone.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Do II. <strong>and</strong> use a branch in CVS, which is even more hassle, but means people can see the changes in advance.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You can&#039;t do anything in CVS (view logs, view “blame” for a line of code, create diffs to previous versions) without being online &amp; connecting to the repository.</div>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

gEDA has a development process that involves a number of people working independently on separate changes.  Some of these are a single changeset hacked together in a few minutes, some involve several major changes and are developed over a matter of months.  Often,  in order to track down a tricky bug, it is necessary for a developer to try and work out what a fellow developer did several months ago.
</p>

<p>
The following features would be deemed desirable in a version control system:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Free as in beer as well as free as in speech.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Actively developed/maintained.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Atomic commits (a.k.a. changesets).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> All users have their own copy of the history.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Users can make local branches/commits without being logged onto a remote server (“distributed” repository model).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Merge &amp; rename tracking.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Easy to transition to from CVS.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_revision_control_software" class="urlextern" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_revision_control_software" rel="nofollow">comparison matrix at Wikipedia</a>, it looks like only <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/" rel="nofollow">Mercurial</a> and <a href="http://git.or.cz/" class="urlextern" title="http://git.or.cz/" rel="nofollow">git</a> have the features we require.
</p>

<p>
A number of factors militate in favour of using git:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Existing experience within the the gEDA development community.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> More extensively used by major projects (Linux kernel, X.org X server, OLPC, WINE).</div>
</li>
</ul>
