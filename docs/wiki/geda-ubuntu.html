<strong>Ubuntu Install Notes</strong>
</p>

<p>
Basic Stable Installation: 
Use apt-get or synaptic to install a stable version from Debian repositories. (easy).  Alternately download a binary .deb from Debian (thanks to Hamish) and you can just sudo dpkg -i &lt;pcb-version.deb&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Build Installation:
Ubuntu doesn&#039;t include everything you need to compile software yourself.  You&#039;ll want to install the &#039;build-essential&#039; package using apt-get or synaptic to get the basic toolchain working on your machine.  (Things like GCC are not inc. in Ubuntu).  For a testing maturity level for PCB or geda, build-essential should be all you need.
</p>

<p>
Be careful as synaptic can do extreme damage to your system.  Do be fooled into replacing libc6 because synaptic will want to remove all applications that depend on it – meaning your entire system.
</p>

<p>
CVS Installation:
For the CVS version of PCB under Edgy, your ./configure step will require running with switch –enable-maintainer-mode.  (more notes needed)
