<p>
I just figured this out, so, here&#039;s how it works, and I&#039;ll formalize this page later.
</p>

<p>
pcb uses the glib testing framework for unit tests: <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Testing.html" class="urlextern" title="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Testing.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Testing.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Look at main-test.c for examples. 
</p>

<p>
In the actual code, you can wrap the unit test stuff in:
</p>
<pre class="code">#ifdef PCB_UNIT_TEST
#endif /* PCB_UNIT_TEST */</pre>

<p>
so that it doesn&#039;t bog things down when not testing. Does it really bog things down when not testing??
</p>

<p>
You need a “&lt;x&gt;_register_tests” function, and then how ever many functions you&#039;re going to use to execute your tests. Put prototypes in the header file. Include the header file in main-test.c, and add a call to the “&lt;x&gt;_register_tests” function in main.
</p>

<p>
In the register function, make a call to g_test_add_func to add whatever testing functions you want to call. It uses a /x/y naming convention, where x is the test module, and y are the individual tests.
</p>

<p>
You have to add the source file to the list of files to be compiled for testing in Makefile.am. Look for the TEST_SRCS variable, and add your files there, in addition to adding them wherever else you need so that pcb compiles them.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can rerun configure (to regen the makefiles), and execute “make check” from the build directory. This will build and execute the tests without necessarily building all of pcb. I&#039;m not sure if this runs the pcb level tests or not.
