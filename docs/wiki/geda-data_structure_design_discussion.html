This is might not exist as a “file”, as such, but exists as a data structure entity to be the owner of the circuits required in a particular design. The “root circuit” is the uppermost level of hierarchy.

<div class="level3">

<p>
A <strong>circuit</strong> entity is the key concept in this model. It defines an electrical block by a its external connections (<strong>MPort</strong>s). A schematic is one way of representing a circuit, hence a circuit object may own or more <strong>page</strong> of schematics.
</p>

<p>
We may also define a <strong>symbolic</strong> (graphic) representation of a circuit - this is like a schematic <strong>page</strong>, however its representation should fit within a single sheet. The minimum a symbolic representation must contain is the <strong>pins</strong> which connect it to higher levels of circuit hierarchy.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT5 SECTION "Circuit" [447-1004] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit6" id="mport">MPort</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
If it is to be useful as a re-usable block, a sub-<strong>circuit</strong> must expose electrical connectivity for a parent <strong>circuit</strong> to connect with. Each such connection is represented by an <strong>Mport</strong> (Master port). This term (re-used from gnetman) represents the fact that once a circuit is instantiated, we need to differentiate between the connections of each specific instance. This is done with instance specific <strong>Port</strong> structures. The <strong>port</strong>s point back at the <strong>Mport</strong>s (master ports) of the circuit representation.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT6 SECTION "MPort" [1005-1541] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit7" id="instance">Instance</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
A <strong>circuit</strong> represents a re-usable electrical entity which we may replicate at various points in our design hierarchy. This is done by instantiating the sub-<strong>circuit </strong> in a higher level of hierarchy. Each instance is associated with an <strong>Instance</strong> structure, which is a placeholder for instance specific attributes such as the sub-circuit&#039;s hierarchical refdes.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT7 SECTION "Instance" [1542-1929] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit8" id="attrib">Attrib</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
An <strong>Attrib</strong> defines meta-data attached which might be attached to a <strong>circuit</strong>, a <strong>circuit</strong>&#039;s <strong>Mport</strong>, a specific <strong>circuit</strong> <strong>instance</strong>, or a <strong>Net</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In a break from gEDA&#039;s current <strong>attrib</strong> model, it makes sense to associate the meta-data directly with the particular entity it pertains to, rather than the graphic representation. This is because some forms of sub-<strong>circuit</strong> entity may be defined without a schematic, and could still require this meta-data. It will be possible to reference any <strong>attrib</strong> within the realm of a <strong>circuit</strong> for display on its schematic <strong>page</strong>(s) where that is desired.
</p>

</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit9" id="netlist">Netlist</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
A <strong>Netlist</strong> defines the electrical connectivity of a <strong>circuit</strong>. It owns a number of <strong>Net</strong>s, which individually represent a single connection between <strong>Mport</strong>s belonging to this <strong>circuit</strong>, and <strong>ports</strong> of instantiated sub-<strong>circuits</strong>. 
</p>

<p>
Initially, it is likely there will only be one netlist for a <strong>circuit</strong> - the one constructed from processing the electrically relevant objects on <strong>page</strong>(s) of the <strong>circuit</strong>&#039;s schematic.
</p>

<p>
Future developments may see multiple netlists for a circuit, possibly some generated / written in an HDL language, and critically, re-exported from a layout package (e.g. PCB). It will be possible to identify and flag up differences in connectivity throughout a design flow, be that from HDL to schematic, or schematic to layout.
</p>

<p>
This has real applications in back-annotation and in design verification.

<!-- EDIT9 SECTION "Netlist" [2570-3435] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit10" id="net">Net</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
A <strong>net</strong> associates with structures forming a given electrical connection within this <strong>circuit</strong>.
</p>

<p>
As we also have a graphical representation of the wires (<strong>ConnSegment</strong>s) which make up this connection, each <strong>Net</strong> can be associated with multiple <strong>ConnSegment</strong>s. The association to <strong>Pins</strong> representing <strong>Mport</strong>s of this <strong>circuit</strong> and to the <strong>Pins</strong> of any instantiated sub-<strong>circuits</strong> is made via a <strong>net</strong>&#039;s association to the appropriate <strong>Mport</strong> and <strong>port</strong> structures.
