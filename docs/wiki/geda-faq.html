<div class="level2">

<p>
The gEDA project has produced and continues working on a full <abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr>&#039;d suite and toolkit of Electronic Design Automation tools. These tools are used for electrical circuit design, schematic capture, simulation, prototyping, and production. Currently, the gEDA project offers a mature suite of free software applications for electronics design, including schematic capture, attribute management, bill of materials (BOM) generation, netlisting into over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital simulation, and printed circuit board (PCB) layout.
</p>

<p>
The gEDA project was launched by Ales Hvezda in Spring 1998 in order to advance the state of free hardware and open source hardware. Over the past ten years, the gEDA software and the community have grown considerably. A few people are contributing to the original tools, while others are doing their own development on their own tools. “gEDA” does not refer solely to the original tools anymore (those tools now stand on their own), but instead to all the projects which are free and are somehow associated with this webpage or the gEDA <a href="geda-mailinglists.html" class="wikilink1" title="geda-mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>. By associating with gEDA, free software authors do not give up any control over their tools, but they gain a community which cares about quality and free (as in freedom) EDA tools.
</p>

<p>
gEDA can be pronounced “gee-daahhh” (rhymes with cheetah) or “g-dahhh (short g).

<div class="level2">

<p>
<strong>gaf</strong> stands for “<em class="u">g</em>schem <em class="u">a</em>nd <em class="u">f</em>riends”. It is a subset of the entire tool suite grouped together under the gEDA name. gEDA/gaf is a collection of tools which currently includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> gschem: A schematic capture program</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> gnetlist: A netlist generation program</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> gsymcheck: A syntax checker for schematic symbols</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> gattrib: A spreadsheet programm that manipulates the properties of symbols of a schematic</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> libgeda: Libraries for gschem gnetlist and gsymcheck</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> gsch2pcb: A tool to forward annotation from your schematic to layout using <a href="http://pcb.geda-project.org" class="urlextern" title="http://pcb.geda-project.org" rel="nofollow">PCB</a></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> some minor utilities</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The gEDA/gaf tools share a common file format (.sch) and also share a common link library (libgeda.so). The gEDA/gaf source distribution can be found on this website (<a href="http://www.geda-project.org" class="urlextern" title="http://www.geda-project.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.geda-project.org</a>).
</p>

<p>
Even though gaf is very much a part of gEDA, the gEDA name does not necessarily only apply to gaf – tools gathered under the “gEDA” moniker include many other programs. Indeed, gEDA refers to <strong>any</strong> <abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr>&#039;d EDA tool which decides to associate itself with the gEDA website/mailing list. Important examples of gEDA tools include the layout program <a href="http://pcb.geda-project.org" class="urlextern" title="http://pcb.geda-project.org" rel="nofollow">PCB</a>, the Verilog compiler <a href="http://www.icarus.com/eda/verilog/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.icarus.com/eda/verilog/" rel="nofollow">Icarus Verilog</a>, the analog circuit simulator <a href="http://www.gnucap.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.gnucap.org/" rel="nofollow">gnucap</a>, and the open-source SPICE simulator <a href="http://www.ngspice.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.ngspice.org/" rel="nofollow">ngspice</a>. Many other gEDA programs also exist.
</p>

<p>
For historical reasons, on <a href="http://freshmeat.net/" class="urlextern" title="http://freshmeat.net/" rel="nofollow">freshmeat</a> gaf is known as the package “gEDA”.

<h2 class="sectionedit5" id="why_what_makes_geda_so_different_from_other_eda_tools">Why? What makes gEDA so different from other EDA tools?</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Tools in the gEDA suite and associated tools have the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Free in the monetary sense (no cost).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> All the file formats and source code are available via the <abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr> license. This license grants specific rights to the authors and users of <abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr>&#039;d software.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Independence from any one vendor. All gEDA tools come with full source. You may freely redistribute, change, improve and port the tools. You may also distribute your changes, if you follow the terms of the <abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> No mechanism is used to restrict the use of the tools (like making use of hard disk serial numbers or ethernet addresses to force the software to only run on one machine).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> No arbitrary, marketeering-driven limitations. Free versions of commercial tools usually include capricious limitations (i.e. limited design size, inability to print, inability to export netlists, etc.) which cripple the program, and force the serious user to buy the real tool. In contrast, the gEDA tools are fully-featured, and do not arbitrarily impose limits on design as a way of extracting money from you.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Legacy design protection. Since the software will always be available, and can always be updated to work with updated operating systems or libraries, gEDA tool design files will always be viewable and editable.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Open design flow. This means that the tools talk to each other via known and documented means (files / APIs). It is easy to replace a tool or augment the tools with something else if you so desire.  The gEDA suite is an EDA toolkit.  The individual pieces are loosely coupled and allow for end users to customize or replaces parts of the design flow.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Stability - Bugs which cause crashes are investigated immediately and fixed as soon as possible.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Minimize bloat and unnecessary features.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Run on as many platforms as possible. For gEDA/gaf: GNU/Linux, various other Unix systems.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Developed in an open (no secrets) fashion.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Strive to be documented.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
gEDA may not have all the latest cutting edge features found in other packages and may be viewed sometimes as being on the trailing edge of EDA technology, but the tools are becoming useful to a lot of people for the above mentioned reasons.

<h2 class="sectionedit6" id="why_does_the_geda_suite_seem_like_a_collection_of_random_programs_and_not_a_single_integrated_application">Why does the gEDA Suite seem like a collection of random programs, and not a single integrated application?</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The gEDA suite is indeed a confederacy of somewhat independent programs. This happened for reasons of history: Ales Hvezda started the gEDA project more or less on his own. The original vision was to produce an end-to-end software suite for creating PC boards so that robotics hobbiests could design their own boards. However, as the gEDA project progressed the large magnitude of this task became clear – and coding many of the proposed apps had not even begun!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, other software developers – with their own independently written applications – found the gEDA project vision compelling. The authors of those applications joined Ales and contributed their programs to the gEDA project. Amongst the contributed projects was “pcb”, a ten year old (at that time) PCB layout program. With the contribution of “pcb”, gEDA’s originally planned layout tool “gpcb” was scuttled. At the same time, other developers contributed analog and digital simulators, waveform viewers, and so on.
</p>

<p>
In this way the gEDA suite came together. It is not shared code, or a common user interface which distinguishes the gEDA suite. Rather, the shared vision of an open-source EDA environment is the thread which holds the project together. Today, the gEDA Suite is a collection of many different programs contributed by many different authors. The apps strive to work together, and usually succeed. But the separate beginnings of each program in the suite are still observable. Nonetheless, with a little work the various components of the suite are interoperable, and many people have completed quite complex board designs using the gEDA suite.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the best way to think about the gEDA suite is as an EDA toolkit.  This toolkit approach gives the end user considerable control.  End users can modify or completely replaces parts of the design flow to suit their own requirements.
</p>

This is ultimately a matter of religion. I’ll summarize some of the pros and cons (as I see them) of each approach here.

<h3 class="sectionedit8" id="suite_confederacy_pros">Suite (confederacy) pros:</h3>
<div class="level3">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You can use “best of breed” applications for each part of the design flow. That is, you can use the standard gEDA flow gschem → gsch2pcb → pcb to create a PC Board. However, if you think that the open-source application “pcb” stinks, you can use the flow gschem → gnetlist → Protel (for example). Recall that gnetlist can output more than twenty different netlist formats! Moreover, if you don’t like one component of the flow, you can write another tool to replace it. Now at this time it is true that only a single application generally exists to perform a particular task. However, this situation will likely change with time – witness the forking of the “pcb” project, the contributed netlister <a href="http://www.viasic.com/opensource/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.viasic.com/opensource/" rel="nofollow">gnetman</a>, as well as the <a href="http://web.comhem.se/~u31829222/" class="urlextern" title="http://web.comhem.se/~u31829222/" rel="nofollow">HEC</a> project. As a general rule, the suite approach offers the greatest freedom to the user.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The design flow has a lot of natural breakpoints. These occur where one design tool completes its job and writes out a file (i.e. gschem writes out a .sch file, or gnetlist writes out a SPICE netlist). At this point, you can easily break into the flow and write scripts which process and/or munge the design data. For big, advanced designs, this is a real advantage to the “design suite” approach. This advantage may appeal only to the “power user”, but note its importance: professional-grade EDA suites (Synopsys, Xilinx) also work the same way.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Usage of an applications suite can be automated using a Makefile, or even a Perl script. ASIC designers do this all the time with their design and synthesis tools. Some gEDA users have stated on the e-mail list that they do this too, and point to it as an important feature of the gEDA suite.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sectionedit9" id="suite_confederacy_cons">Suite (confederacy) cons:</h3>
<div class="level3">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> More confusing to new users, since they don’t know the flow right off the bat. That is, they actually need to <abbr title="Read The Fine Manual">RTFM</abbr> to know what tool to run next. Good documentation helps (that’s why you’re reading this), but documentation is always second choice behind developing an intuitive application interface.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Different programs have different UI conventions. That is, menu organization, keyboard and mouse bindings are inconsistent. This can be uncomfortable even to those who are familiar with the programs.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Since no assumptions are made about the design flow, schematic symbols are necessarily <a href="geda-faq-gschem.html#what_s_this_business_about_heavy_vs._light_symbols" class="wikilink1" title="geda-faq-gschem.html">light</a>. This forces the user to spend more time attaching e.g. footprint attributes to his design. Moreover, the user must spend more time actually researching which footprints to use.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Some developers are more energetic than others, or have more free time. Therefore, some programs in a suite will be more developed (and less buggy) than others.

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Lack of choice. If the developer doesn’t like your way of doing things, you have no choice.

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Risk. If the developer quits, the code becomes abandoned, and the users suffer. This effectively happened to the program <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xtrkcad" class="urlextern" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xtrkcad" rel="nofollow">XTrkCAD</a>, a CAD program for designing model railroads. The author of this program quit developing it, but thankfully placed his stuff on Sourceforge so that the program wouldn’t simply disappear. Unfortunately, without the original developer’s involvement, the code languished. Patches contributed to the project went to /dev/null. Eventually, a coalition of concerned user/developers created a <a href="http://xtrkcad-fork.sourceforge.net/" class="urlextern" title="http://xtrkcad-fork.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">fork</a> of the code to enable further development. However, work on the forked code has been piecemeal and sporadic. (Hopefully, this will change someday.)

<p>
Newbies sometimes show up on the gEDA mailing lists and flame the project for missing features, perceived bugs, and supppoesd UI quirks.  The gEDA developers are very interested in receiving constructive feedback and criticism, so we do welcome feature requests and bug reports.  But please keep in mind that the developers are full-time professional EEs or software engineers, and work on gEDA as an unpaid, fun hobby.  Unconstructive or ill-informed flames are not the way to get new features implemented.
</p>

<p>
If you need a new feature implemented in one of the gEDA tools, here are your options:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Write it yourself.  The code is open and available for everybody to see, understand, and modify.  If you have implemented a new feature, please <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/geda" class="urlextern" title="http://bugs.launchpad.net/geda" rel="nofollow">submit your patches</a> to the project; chances are good that they will be incorporated into the main development branch.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Ask politely on the gEDA e-mail lists. If your feature request is simple, or of interest to one of the developers, it&#039;s possible that somebody will implement your feature.  If it&#039;s more complicated, it&#039;s likely that the feature is already under discussion amongst the developers, but nobody has enough spare time to implement it. (You can also submit feature requests via the <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/geda" class="urlextern" title="http://bugs.launchpad.net/geda" rel="nofollow">Launchpad bug tracker.</a>) Please don&#039;t rant or flame on the e-mail lists, since you will likely be flamed right back and you won&#039;t get your feature either. Why waste your time?</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If the above possibilities don&#039;t work for you, hire an open-source developer to write the feature for you! It&#039;s amazing how often this possibility is ignored. People willing to pay $25,000 – $100,000 for commercial EDA tools will balk at paying a teen-age programming whiz $10/hr to re-create the same features in the gEDA Suite. Why? If you&#039;re an educator, consider hiring some students for a UROP project to work on gEDA. If you run a business, hire a teenager or somebody fresh out of school! And if you want seasoned help, you can (soon) turn to some of the main gEDA developers who do consulting.</div>
