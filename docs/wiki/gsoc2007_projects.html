<div class="level3">

<p>
This page contains various ideas for projects. You can use these as fodder for creating your application to Google. Also, if you have your own idea, feel free to share it with the gEDA developers – they might like it more than any project on this list!
</p>

<p>
Note that some of these projects are too small by themselves to be stand-alone projects. The Summer of Code program is a 3 month program, and you&#039;re supposed to treat your project as a full-time job. Applicants should keep that in mind and possibly combine ideas from different projects if one suggested project is too small. To help you, I have graded each project on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 = too small for a full summer, 3 = roughly enough for a full summer, and 5 = way too large for a full summer. Of course, what takes one programmer one week might take another six months, so any judgement is subjective. However, you can use these ratings to help you figure out which project is the right one for you.
</p>

<p>
The vast majority of gEDA Suite programs are written in either C or C++. However, a whole range of scripting languages are used including scheme (guile), perl, python, bourne shell, tcl/tk, and others. <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> toolkit use is also fairly broad including GTK+ (this is the primary toolkit of most of the programs), Lesstif, WxWidgets, and others. We are pretty much open to using most languages or <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> toolkits for new programs, however some of the projects listed below will require knowledge of a specific language and/or <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> toolkit (as they are well established programs).

<div class="level3">

<p>
gEDA needs a new, top-level project manager. Using this tool, A user would type “geda” at the command line (or push a button on his desktop manager), and this program would start a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> which would provide easy, user-friendly access to all design tools. The project manager would implement (at least) the following functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Menu items or buttons to run various gEDA programs like gschem, gattrib, gsch2pcb, PCB, gerbv, ngspice, Gnucap, etc.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Manage resource files (i.e. the project manager allows you to edit and write gafrc, gsch2pcb project file, spinit, etc.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Enable creation of project archives – i.e. using garchive, but using an intelligent method to gather &amp; archive the symbols &amp; footprints used in the project.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Perhaps implement some type of lockfiles, or at least some enforcement of the design flow (good for newbies).</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since the project manager is the first program seen by many new users, this program needs a high degree of polish, and should enforce good design practice without getting in the user&#039;s way too much.

PCB&#039;s support for non-copper layers needs improvement. In this project, you would add support for more easily-editable non-copper layers.

<div class="level3">

<p>
In this project, the student would create a program which reads a Gerber file, and creates an output file which is a metal layer or footprint editable by PCB. This might be a Perl or Python script. Such a program is very desirable since it gives users the ability to edit legacy designs – i.e. those for which they only have Gerbers.

<div class="level3">

<p>
Ngspice and Gnucap are the gEDA Project&#039;s analog circuit simulators. They are both command-line tools, meaning that you type commands into a shell-like program at a prompt. However, some popular commercial simulators support easy simulation and analysis directly from within a schematic capture <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>. This method of working is particularly well suited to newbies.
</p>

<p>
A new user would like to do the following things inside gschem:
</p>
<ul>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Specify which voltages and currents should be plotted</div>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
The simulation runs and the postprocessing may be in an extra program that is triggered by IPC. More thoughts about the project have been entered by Werner Hoch on the gEDA Wiki.
</p>

<p>
This project involves tightening the link between gschem and the back-end simulation programs. This might be done using some type of IPC, such as DBUS. Indeed, a preliminary DBUS implementation for gschem ↔ PCB already exists; the student might leverage the DBUS work for this project.

<h3 class="sectionedit6" id="parts_manager">Parts manager</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
In this project, you would create a parts manager that takes a graphical symbol and a physical footprint, and marries the two to produce a heavy part. In addition, this tool should be able to support multiple backend flows. By this I mean that the parts manager should be able to also indicate how the symbol should be netlisted for spice, gnucap, or other backends. If possible it would be nice to integrate this into gschem in a way that allowed symbols to be placed and the footprint attribute to come up with a list of choices.
</p>

<p>
Another possible direction for improved parts management is to create a program like gattrib (or perhaps just re-use gattrib) which reads a bunch of .sch files, and also interfaces to an SQL database holding all info about parts (including spice models, footprints, .pdf datasheets, etc) . The program would then allow users to perform database searches for footprints and other attributes stored as columns in the database.

<h3 class="sectionedit7" id="gnetlist_gnetman_support_for_hierarchy">Gnetlist/gnetman support for hierarchy</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The goal of this project is to create a scalable, professional-grade netlister. The project might involve re-writing gnetlist to enable hierarchical designs, or might involve upgrading “gnetman” to incorporate scripted back-ends. The upgrade would be done with an eye towards scalability. Ideally, highly capable and efficient internal data structures and methods for accessing the netlist database should be used. Then a scheme/guile <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> provided for an external script engine. (It may be beneficial to use swig to allow easy interfacing to multiple scripting languages.) The idea is to produce a netlister capable of handling large, hierarchical designs while still allowing users to write their own netlisters for their favorite netlist format (as gnetlist does now).
</p>

<p>
Gnetman is probably the logical starting point since the database was designed by someone with a lot of experience in EDA, and it uses datadraw which is a proven high power CASE tool. However, the student may take whatever approach he wishes, but should provide a strong argument that his approach makes sense before starting coding. In any event, It will be important to provide a compatibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for the existing backends while providing a more high power and flexible <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for new backends and improvements of the old ones.

<p>
In this project, you would expand libgeda (if needed) to provide a complete enough guile interface to be able to do more complex database manipulations. One use would be to have a back annotation tool that used libgeda instead of relying on perl. The problem with perl is that you&#039;ve involved Yet Another Gschem Parser. This actually may be combined with the previous project about rewriting the gnetlist internals.

<div class="level3">

<p>
Gsch2pcb is a key program in the gEDA Suite. It made it relatively easy to take a schematic drawn using gschem and prepare it for layout using PCB. It has played an important role in popularizing gEDA for PCB design amongst students and hobbyists. However, it has a flaw: It uses footprint search paths which can be different from those in PCB. Users are sometimes perplexed that they can see footprints in PCB, but gsch2pcb claims it can&#039;t find them. Or gsch2pcb gives them footprints different from the ones they expect to see based upon a footprint search using PCB. In addition, gsch2pcb needs to be able to parse the PCB .pcb files directly. This means many file format changes trigger a required update to gsch2pcb.
</p>

<p>
It would be more preferable for gsch2pcb to be able to query PCB through a well defined and stable <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> to find out the information it needs. In addition, rather than trying to duplicate PCB&#039;s mechanism for creating a new board and locating footprints, gsch2pcb should simply instruct PCB to peform these operations.

A Verilog code generator targets to emit simplified Verilog code. This has use as a Verilog “reducer” (or obfuscator) to translate verilog to more simplified forms. It can also be used to support other Verilog run time engines.

<p>
A variant of this is to generate VHDL, and thus get a VHDL translation from the Verilog input.

<p>
This task remains pretty clear of the core Icarus Verilog compiler and just works with loadable code generators.
SDF Parser/Annotator for Icarus Verilog
</p>

<p>
SDF parser to parse SDF files generated by typical SDF sources such as Xilinx ISE. It should be possible to invoke this from an $sdf_annotate system task and match paths with the specify paths actually available (via vpi) in the design.
</p>

<p>
The specify paths are now available in the vvp run time, some work is needed to offer up the VPI objects that an SDF annotator needs.
</p>

<p>
This task can mostly be done in C and loaded as a VPI module. There is some work needed in the vvp run time engine to make the paths available to VPI modules, though.
Macros with Arguments
</p>

<p>
The Icarus Verilog preprocessor currently does not support macros with arguments. A good task would be to add support for arguments. This task would work entirely within the ivlpp program that does the preprocessing for the ivl core. It is written in C and bison and would be a good task for someone not an expert in Verilog or EE in general.

<p>
Add hooks into gschem needed to fully support things like backannotation of simulation results and click-to-plot results. Specifically, this would enable you to draw a schematic in gschem, then simulate it in ngspice without leaving gschem. The simulation plots would then appear in a graphical pop-up window.

<h3 class="sectionedit34" id="ipc_footprint_calculator">IPC Footprint Calculator</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Build a footprint calculator that can take the IPC rules and produce a pcb footprint. Preferably write this in a way where the core program is independent of a gui so that you can script it for generating entire large families of footprints or hook it up to a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> of choice (lesstif, gtk, maybe even cgi). Would require the purchase of IPC-7351 (approximately U.S.A. $100)and verifying that one is allowed to produce such a calculator.
