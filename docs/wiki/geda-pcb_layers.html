<p>
“New layout” templates and wizards. (instead of defaulting to 4&times;4 8-layer)
</p>

<p>
Ability to hook into layer exporters (i.e. thindraw as a HID)
</p>

<p>
Also, trim polygons against “outline” layer.  Fix polygons in general.

There are “Layer groups” which contain “conductive layers”. One “Layer group” is actually one “physical layer”.
There is max 10 layer groups. Number of layers is 16 + 2 silk screen layers. Layers have no “type”.

<p>
In the next part terms “physical layer” and “layer” are used. It can be changed to better names. Having just “layer” for
“physical layer” and something else for “layer” will be great. Would “surface” go? Layer for one layer on PCB and surface for
one drawing surface.
</p>

<p>
Layers are contained in a linked list, so there is no bounds on the number of them. “Physical layers” should probably be also
in a linked list.
</p>

<p>
The Z-order of “physical layers” and “layers” is determined by the order in linked list and in layout file.
</p>

<p>
Active “layer” of each type is represented as pointer in “physical layer”. There is
an array of size “number of layer types”, pointer on right place is the active layer.
There is no need to have an active layer of each type.
</p>

<p>
One “physical layer” can be marked as “top” and one as “bottom”, so new footprints have some default layers assignment.
This marks are useful just for footprint importing, there is no other use for them.
</p>

<p>
When adding anything (components, lines, polygons), all parts goes to the active layer of the right type for current “physical layer”.
So line is added to active “conductive layer”, its mask to active “mask layer”,…. If there is no such layer, nothing happens.
If the current layer is not conductive, something else can happen. Like adding polygon to “mask layer” will just mask/unmask that part….
</p>

<p>
There are two types of colors. The ones defined in application preferences and the ones defined in layout file.
User can select to see any of the sets.
</p>

<p>
Colors in preferences are assigned to layer names, not layer numbers.
</p>

<p>
There is no concept of “layer number” everything is referred by name or pointer.
</p>

<p>
Each “physical layer” has Dimension property and can also have an Outline layer.
The difference is, that NOTHING can be drawn out of dimension. The Outline is just
hint how to manufactor the board. The Dimension is just one rectangle, Outline can have any
shape. This Dimension property should replace the “Board dimension” currently defined in preferences.
</p>

<p>
Gerber output names will contain “physical layer” name.
</p>

<p>
The “Show Pin/Pads/Vias” flags in “Physical layer” is just inspecting and printing use.
It doesn&#039;t hurt to have and can aid documentation generation.
</p>

<code>Physical layer:<br/>

Name ← this will be used in gerber export<br/>

Dimentions ← layer doesn&#039;t have to be across whole board<br/>

Flags ← some “physical layer” wide flags<br/>

Layers ← linked list of layers in this “physical layer”<br/>

Pointer to layers ← linked list of all layers in this physical layer<br/>

Conductive ← the only conductive layer<br/>

Mechanical ← some additional non-conductive stuff<br/>

Outline ← outline of board<br/>

Silk ← Texts, component oulines,…<br/>

Mask ← mask on the board<br/>

Paste ← solder paste definition<br/>

Countryard ← component spacing definition<br/>

Rat<br/>

<br/>

Physical layer flags:<br/>

Show Pin/Via/Pads ← Show/Hide Pin/Via/Pads, 3 separate flags – NOT SAVED, the one in “Layer” is saved<br/>

<br/>

Layer flags:<br/>

Visible ← Show/Hide this layer – just temporal use, NOT SAVED<br/>

Show Pin/Via/Pads ← 3 separate flags, On some layers for special purpose it make sense to not include Via/Pin/Pads<br/>

Negativness ← Layer is negative layer<br/>
