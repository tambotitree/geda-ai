		- Did not add any net= attribs to any v* symbol
		- Made sure all the v*-1.sym are consistant

	Removed vdd-1.sym and renamed vdd-2.sym to be vdd-1.sym

		- All locked components need to be color 15 (locked)
		- All text items need to be color 9
	
	Did all title blocks (updated locked color to 15)
