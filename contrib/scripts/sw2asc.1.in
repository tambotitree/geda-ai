.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.I sw2asc
program reads the switcap.out output file produced by SWITCAP2 and produces
a set of ASCII datafiles which can be more easily loaded into various waveform
plotting programs. 

Data generated by SWITCAP2 "PRINT" statements is;
extracted and written to an output file in an ASCII format which can be
directly loaded by the 
.I gwave
waveform viewer or more easily loaded into
a tool such as 
.I scilab
,
.I octave
,
.I grace,
, or 
.I matlab
.

If multiple analyses are in the SWITCAP2 output file, then they are written
to individual files.  The output file names are derived from the input
file name by appending ".{SSS,TRAN}.#.asc"" to the name of the input file.
SSS is used for Sinusoidal Steady State analysis output and TRAN is used for.
TRANsient analysis output.  # corresponds to the analysis number (ie if you
have 3 SSS analyses in your file, you will end up with .SSS.1.asc, .SSS.2.asc,
and .SSS.3.asc.
