.SH NAME
gnet_hier_verilog.sh \- generate a non-flattened hierarchical Verilog netlist.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnet_hier_verilog.sh
.I filename.sch

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gnet_hier_verilog.sh
is a simple script to produce a
hierarchical verilog netlist in a single file.
It gathers hierarchical information from a list of
unique symbols/schematics originating from the top level
schematic all the way down to the lowest level of the
design hierarchy. It then successively invokes the
existing gEDA verilog netlister to produce each single
level netlists, and concatinates all the unique
module netlists into one single hierarchical netlist
file.
.PP
Currently,
.B gnet_hier_verilog
assumes that one or more hierarchical symbol
can be represented by a single schematic file. If needed,
feature for mutiple schematic files mapped to a single symbol
can be easily added. In that case, multiple source attrib
are used in that symbol.
