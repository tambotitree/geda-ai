#
# SPICE netlist backend written by S. Gieltjes
#
# further modified by W. Kazubski to use scaling parameters for
# devices other than MOSFETS
#
# Started with gnet-spice1.scm by W. Kazubski.  Radically
# hacked by SDB to support advanced spice netlist generation.
# Project started 2003-03-05 -- SDB.
#
# Details and documentation at http://www.brorson.com/gEDA/SPICE/
#
# Change log:
# 2003-03-05 -- Started hacking.  SDB.
# 2003-03-17 -- 2nd version.  Hacked to allow for .SUBCKT files to model
#               ics.  Changed write-ic.  Added get-file-type.  Added
#               write-subcircuit.  SDB.
# 2003-03-31 -- 3rd version.  Hacked to enable creating .SUBCKT schematics
#               for hierarchical circuit modeling.
# 2003-08-29 -- 4th version.  Include patches from Ken Healy to sort
#               netlist, code by SDB to use gnetlist command line args in
#               Scheme fcns, as well as from Theo Deckers to fix strange
#               problem with '.SUBCKT quoting.
# 2003-09-09 -- 5th version.  Rearranged code for more organization (I was
#               beginning to get lost. . . .).  Incorporated changes to
#               handle external SPICE files more intelligently.  Changed
#               spew to be configurable by setting -v from the command line.
#               Placed new fcn debug-spew into gnetlist.scm.
#               Added -I command line flag.
# 2003-10-14 -- Bugfixes: Added empty-string? and hacked get-file-type to
#               handle case where a model file has an empty line before
#               .SUBCKT or .MODEL.
#               Also modified write-net-names-on-component to gracefully
#               handle case where not every pin has a pinseq attribute.
#               Now only outputs pins with valid pinseq attribute.
# 2003-12-25 -- Bugfix: Unswizzled emission of pins from user-defined
#               .subckts.  (Now correctly uses pinseq to define emission
#               order of pins.)  Also added ability to emit attributes for
#               semiconductors (e.g. area, off, ic, etc.)  Added in response
#               to user requests.
# 2003-12-29 -- * Two small enhancements requested by Peter Kaiser.
#               * Minor bugfix.
#               * Second minor bugfix.
#               * Change res & cap to incorporate modelname & "area=" attrib.
# 2004-03-24 -- Bugfixes made to JFET stuff during Feb.  Change released now.
# 2004-08-22 -- Added command line as first line of file.
# 2004-08-29 -- Changed sense source naming in controlled sources because
#               the old convention was confusing ngspice.
# 2004-10-09 -- Added patches for voltage controlled switches from
#               Peter Kaiser.
# 2005-03-16 -- Fixed CCCS bug (typo in Vsense) noticed by David Logan
# 2005-05-16 -- Modified behavior of .INCLUDE directive.  Now by default it
#               just spits out the string instead of putting the contents of
#               the file into the SPICE netlist.  You can force insertion of
#               the file using the -e flag.
# 2005-06-12 -- Changed order of writing out netlist and .model/.subckt
#               cards to facilitate use of numparam with ngspice.  Change
#               supplied by Dominique Michel.
# 2005-09-11 -- Incorporated patch from Paul Bunyk to enable netlisting of
#               Josephson junctions and "K" mutual inductances.  Also
#               enabled netlisting of "COIL" devices as inductors.
# 2005-12-27 -- Fix bug discovered by John Doty: spice-IO pins with refdes
#               greater than P9 were sorted incorrectly (as strings).  Now
#               they are sorted as numbers.
# 2006-03-10 -- Added "m" attribute to PMOS and NMOS per request of
#               Peter Kaiser.
# 2006-04-11 -- Changed the .END and .ENDS cards to lowercase.
#               This fixes bug 1442912. Carlos Nieves Onega.
# 2007-02-10 -- Various bugfixes.  Also incorporated slotted part netlist
#               patch from Jeff Mallatt.  SDB.
# 2007-04-28 -- Fixed slotted part stuff so that it uses pinseq to emit
#               pins.  SDB
# 2008-01-09 -- Fix slotted part handling to work without a modified pinseq.
#               pcjc2
# 2011-01-03 -- Combine write-ic and write-subcircuit with a fix to the
#               unbound type variable.  Fully document a check for the
#               special "?" value explaining why it fails silently.  Clean
#               up write-net-names-on-component to make it a bit more
#               flexible.
#               Combine write-probe-item and write-net-names-on-component.
#               Add a range utility function.  CC
# 2011-01-13 -- Add four lines of code (and some comments) that allow
#               formaitting strings to be used for netlisting NGspice device
#               models.  CC
# 2011-06-12 -- Updated the Problematci name=? symbols to name=unknown and
#               removed the FIXME check for them.  This should be a step
#               closer to place holder consistancy.  CC
# 2015-05-14 -- Translated to Python.  Roland Lutz

# Write-transistor-diode: writes out component followed by model or

# This function does the following:
#   1.  Writes out the correct refdes prefix (if specified and necessary).
#   2.  Writes out the refdes and nets
#   3.  Looks for "model-name" attribute. Writes it out if it exists.
#   4.  If there is no "model-name" attribute, it writes out the "value"
#       attribute.  If there is no "value" attribute, it writes out "unknown"
#       and returns, causing the spice simulator to puke when the netlist
#       is run.  This is important
#       'cause the spice simulator needs to have some indication of what
#       model to look for.
#   5.  Outputs optional attributes attached to device, if any.  Feature
#       added by SDB on 2003-12-25.
#   6.  Outputs a new line
#   7.  Looks for a the "model" attribute.  If it exists, it it writes out

# Spice netlist generation.
# This is the entry point.
#
# Hacked on 2003-03-31 to enable writing out .SUBCKT models -- SDB.
# Hacked again in Sept 2003 to enable more intelligent embedding of
# external SPICE files into netlist -- SDB.
# The algorithm is as follows:
# 1.  Figure out if there is a .SUBCKT block on the schematic,
#     or if it is just a normal schematic.
#     If a .SUBCKT:
#     -- Write out subcircuit header (a comment identifying the netlister).
#     -- find all spice-IO pins.  Get a list of the packages.
#     -- put them in order (ordered by package refdes)
#     -- get the list of nets attached to the spice-IO pins.
#     -- write out .SUBCKT line
#     If a normal schematic:
#     -- Write out top header (a comment identifying the netlister).
# 2.  Loop through all components, looking for components with a "file"
#     attribute.  Every time a "file" attribute is found do this:
#     --  Open the file and find out what kind of file it is (.SUBCKT
#         or .MODEL).
#     --  Determine if the file has previously been processed.  If
#         not: stick the following info into the file-info list:
#         (model_name, file_name, file_type).  Otherwise just continue.
# 3.  Loop through all components again, and write out a SPICE card for each.
# 4.  Afterwards, for each item in the file-info list, open the file,
#     and write its contents into the netlist.
# 5.  If the schematic-type is .SUBCKT: write out .ENDS, otherwise
#     write out .END
# 6.  Close up the SPICE netlist file and return.
