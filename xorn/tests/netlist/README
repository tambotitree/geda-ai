Tests for xorn-netlist
======================

These are the original tests used by gnetlist which compare the
netlister output for a set of test schematics with known good output
files.  To run the tests, type:

    make check

Since xorn-netlist produces slightly different output than the old
gnetlist binary, the reference output files have been modified to
accomodate these differences.

- The original order in which the pins on a net used to be listed in
  gnetlist is hard to predict and depends on the internal connectivity
  checking algorithm.  Since it's *almost* the order of the pins in
  the file, they are now sorted in that order.

- The VAMS backend included all attributes on the first component of a
  package in the output except "refdes", "source", and "architecture".
  For slotted packages, this means a semi-arbitrary value for "slot"
  was used.  The new attribute code considers all components of a
  package and raises an error if there are inconsistent values.
  Therefore, the "slot" attribute is now excluded, too.

- gnetlist:vams-get-package-attributes returned the names of all
  attributes attached to a package's first component, including those
  which have been set to "unknown".  This has been fixed; now only
  attributes whose value is not "unknown" are listed in the output.

- If an artificial pin was present in multiple components of a
  package, get-pins and get-pins-nets returned the pin once for each
  component, resulting in duplicate pins in the output.  This has been
  fixed; each pin in now listed only once.

- The renamed-nets section in the test backend has been removed as it
  isn't meaningful any longer.

- With the new subsheet link-up code, the order of the pins on an
  inter-schematic net connected to multiple ports now depends
  primarily on the order of the pins of the subsheet symbol instead of
  the order of the pins inside the subsheet.

- Some of the errors covered in the DRC2 tests are now detected by the
  netlister and cause it to abort with an error, so netlist errors are
  ignored for this backend.

The tests do NOT cover most of the more advanced features of the
backends; they are basically just a bunch of standard schematics run
through each backend, whether meaningful or not.

Please note that the tests only make sure there are no accidental new
defects.  In particular, it has not been checked whether the original
output files were correct in the first place.
