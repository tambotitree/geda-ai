.SH NAME
gaf - gEDA/gaf Command-Line Utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B gaf
[\fIOPTION\fR ...] \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIARGS\fR ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.B gaf
is part of the gEDA (GPL Electronic Design Automation) toolset.  It
provides a number of small command-line utilities for working with
schematic and symbol files, and is designed to be used for batch
processing of designs created using the schematic editor
\fBgschem\fR(1).  It currently has three built-in \fICOMMAND\fRs:

.B gaf export
is used to create SVG, PDF, PNG, PS and EPS files from schematic and
symbol files, for printing or embedding in other documents.

.B gaf config
allows reading and writing settings in gEDA project, user and system
configuration stores.

.B gaf shell
provides a Scheme REPL for command-line batch processing of schematic
data.

.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP 8
\fB--no-rcfiles\fR
Prevent `gafrc' Scheme initialisation files from being loaded.
.TP 8
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print a help message.
.TP 8
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print \fBgaf\fR version information.

.SH "EXPORTING IMAGE FILES"
.B gaf export
[\fIOPTION\fR ...] \fB-o\fR \fIOUTPUT\fR [\fI--\fR] \fIFILE\fR ...

.B gaf export
can export schematic and symbol files in a variety of image formats
for printing or further processing.  It currently supports single-page
PNG, SVG and EPS output, and multi-page PS and PDF output.  It accepts
a variety of options for controlling how the output is formatted.

.TP 8
\fB-o\fR, \fB--output\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Output generated image data to \fIFILE\fR.
.TP 8
\fB-f\fR, \fB--format\fR=(\fBpng\fR | \fBpdf\fR | \fBsvg\fR | \fBps\fR | \fBeps\fR)
Specify an output format.  Usually, this option is not required,
because \fBgaf export\fR will infer the correct format from the file
extension of the output file.
.TP 8
\fB-p\fR, \fB--paper\fR=\fINAME\fR
Size the output for a particular paper size.  The \fINAME\fR should be
a PWG 5101.1-2002 paper name.  For example, valid values include
`iso_a4', `na_letter', or `na_d'.
.TP 8
\fB-l\fR, \fB--layout\fR=(\fBauto\fR | \fBlandscape\fR | \fBportrait\fR)
When using a paper size, set the orientation of the output.  If `auto'
layout is used, the orientation that best fits the drawing will be
used.
.TP 8
\fB-s\fR, \fB--size\fR=(\fBauto\fR | \fIWIDTH\fR:\fIHEIGHT\fR)
Size the output with specific dimensions.  If the size is `auto',
select the size that best fits the drawing.
.TP 8
\fB-k\fR, \fB--scale\fR=\fIFACTOR\fR
Set the output scale \fIFACTOR\fR. This is a distance identical with 100
points (1 default grid spacing) in \fBgschem\fR(1) coordinate space. It is used
to size the output when neither \fB--paper\fR nor \fB--size\fR are
given, and defaults to 100 mil.
.TP 8
\fB-m\fR, \fB--margins\fR=(\fBauto\fR | \fITOP\fR[:\fILEFT\fR[:\fIBOTTOM\fR[:\fIRIGHT\fR]]])
Set the widths of the margins to be used.  If `auto' margins are
specified, a sensible default value will be chosen.  Up to four margin
widths can be provided.  If one is provided, it will be used on all
four sides.  If two are provided, the first will be used for the
top/bottom and the second for the left/right.  If three are provided,
the first will be used for the top, the second for left/right, and the
third for the bottom.
.TP 8
\fB-a\fR, \fB--align\fR=(\fBauto\fR | \fIHALIGN\fR:\fIVALIGN\fR)
Set how the drawing is aligned within the page.  \fIHALIGN\fR controls
the horizontal alignment, and \fIVALIGN\fR the vertical.  Each
alignment value should be in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  The `auto'
alignment is equivalent to a value of `0.5:0.5', i.e. centered.
.TP 8
\fB-d\fR, \fB--dpi\fR=\fIDPI\fR
Set the number of pixels per inch used when generating PNG output.
.TP 8
\fB-c\fR, \fB--color\fR
Enable colour output.
.TP 8
\fB--no-color\fR
Disable color output.
.TP 8
\fB-F\fR, \fB--font\fR=\fIFONT-FAMILY\fR
Set the font to be used for drawing text.
.TP 8
\fB--\fR
Treat all remaining arguments as schematic or symbol filenames.  Use
this if you have a schematic or symbol filename which begins with `-'.

.PP
The \fB--size\fR, \fB--margins\fR, or \fB--scale\fR options described above accept
values using units of `mm', `cm', `in', `pc', `px', or `pt'.  If you
do not provide a unit, points are assumed.  N.b. that `px' are
evaluated relative to the current \fB--dpi\fR setting.

.PP
When using the \fB--size\fR, \fB--margins\fR, or \fB--align\fR options
with multiple values, you may use `;', or ` ' as a separator between
them instead of `:'. In such a case, remember to properly quote your
arguments to avoid them to be interpreted by your shell.


.SH "ACCESSING CONFIGURATION"
.B gaf config
[\fIOPTION\fR] [\fIGROUP\fR \fIKEY\fR [\fIVALUE\fR]]

.B gaf config
is a basic utility for inspecting and modifying gEDA/gaf configuration
stores.

.PP
If a \fIGROUP\fR and \fRKEY\fR are specified, retrieves the value of
that configuration parameter.  If a \fIVALUE\fR is specified, sets
the value of that parameter.  The \fB-p\fR, \fB-u\fR and \fB-s\fR
options can be used to select the configuration store affected (by
default, the project configuration store for the current working
directory).  If no \fIGROUP\fR and \fIKEY\fR are provided, outputs
the filename of the selected configuration store.

.PP
.TP 8
\fB-p\fR, \fB--project\fR[=\fIPATH\fR]
Select the project configuration store of the project located in
\fIPATH\fR.  If no \fIPATH\fR is provided, selects the project in the
current working directory.
.TP 8
\fB-u\fR, \fB--user\fR
Select the user configuration store.
.TP 8
\fB-s\fR, \fB--system\fR
Select the system configuration store.  Depending on user permissions,
the system configuration store may be read-only.

.SH "SCHEME PROCESSING"
.B gaf shell
[\fIOPTION ...\fR]

.B gaf shell
provides a Scheme Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for automating
processing of schematic and symbol files.  It is designed to be used
with the gEDA Scheme API.

.TP 8
\fB-s\fR \fIFILE\fR
Evaluate Scheme source code from \fIFILE\fR, and exit.
.TP 8
\fB-c\fR \fIEXPR\fR
Evaluate the Scheme expression \fIEXPR\fR, and exit.
.TP 8
\fB--\fR
Stop scanning arguments; run interactively.
.TP 8
\fB-L\fR \fIDIRECTORY\fR
Prepend \fIDIRECTORY\fR to the list of directories to be searched for
Scheme files.
.TP 8
\fB-l\fR \fIFILE\fR
Evaluate Scheme source code from \fIFILE\fR.

.PP
The \fB-s\fR, \fB-c\fR and \fB--\fR switches stop argument processing
and pass all the remaining arguments as the value of `(command-line)'.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
.B GEDADATA
specifies the search directory for Scheme and rc files.  The default
is `${prefix}/share/gEDA'.
.TP 8
.B GEDADATARC
specifies the search directory for rc files.  The default is `$GEDADATA'.
.TP 8
.B GEDALOG
specifies the directory to which to write log files.  The default is
`~/.gEDA/logs'.
