This file describes where the various icons came from and their license.

These application icons were created by Peter Clifton, based upon the
Gnome "text-editor" icon created by Lapo Calamandrei. The gEDA specific
additions are from the mime-type icons by Tomaz Solc.
These icons are licensed under the GPL2 license.
