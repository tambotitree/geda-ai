INTRODUCTION

Gattrib is gEDA's attribute editor.  It reads a set of gschem .sch
files (schematic files), and creates a spreadsheet showing all
components in rows, with the associated component attributes listed in
the columns.  It allows the user to add, modify, or delete component
attributes outside of gschem, and then save the .sch files back
out.  When it is completed, it will allow the user to edit attributes
attached to components, nets, and pins.  (Currently, only component
attribute editing is implemented; pin and net attributes are displayed
only.)

Gattrib is useful in situations where you need to view, add, modify,
or delete a number of attributes all at once.  It saves you the pain
of clicking on each component and repeatedly using gschem's attribute 
editor to modify component attributes.  For example, if you create a
large design with generic components, and then later want to attach
"footprint" attributes to your components, it is a real hassle to do
so using gschem.  In this situation, you can run gattrib on your
design files to attach the "footprint" attributes all at once using an
easy-to-use spreadsheet. 

WARNING NOTE:  Gattrib has been tested on many designs, 
but is not guaranteed to work.  It may even trash your design!
Therefore, always keep a back-up copy of your design files.  Note that
this is good advice when using any software on critical files. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE

You can invoke gattrib on your design from the command line in the
following way:

gattrib my_design_*.sch

(This assumes you have a multi-page design with file names
"my_design_1.sch", "my_design_2.sch", etc.)  Gattrib will then read in
your design, and present you with a spreadsheet showing all components
and associated attributes. 

You can also just run gattrib, and specify the input files using the
file->open dialog box.

To edit your attributes, just edit the cells in the spreadsheet.  

To save your design, just select "save" from the command menu.  Note
that no checks are currently done when you select save.  Be careful!

You can also save out a csv (comma separated values) file, which can
later be imported into e.g. oocalc.  This is useful for BOM
management. 

To quit, just select "quit" from the command menu.  Note that
currently no checks thet you have saved your design are done when you
quit.  

If you want to add an entirely new attribute to your design (i.e. one
which doesn't exist on any component), you can do this through "edit
-> add new attribute column".  You can also delete an entire attribut
column.

You can set the visibility of any particular attribute, or an entire
column of attributes through the "visibility" menu.  Just select the
attribute or column first, then do "visibility -> <whatever>".

FEATURES

The following features are currently implemented:

*  .sch file read in from command line.
*  .sch file read in from menu.
*  .sch file save out from menu.
*  CSV (comma separated value) file save out from menu.
*  Component attribute editing (of course).
*  Net attribute viewing.
*  Pin attribute viewing.
*  Add/delete attribute columns.
*  Changing visibility of attributes.
*  Quit from menu.

The following features are currently unimplemented, but will be
incorporated at some future date:

*  Throw up "Are you sure" dialog boxes upon selecting "save" from
   menu. (Is this really necessary?)
*  Editing of net attributes (important for setting routing
   attributes). 
*  Search/replace of individual attributes.
*  Search for component refdeses & netnames.
*  Indicate component visibility by changing the color of the
   attribute in each cell.  Example:  Invisible = light grey.
   Name only = red. Value only = normal black.  Name & value = bold
   face. 

Note that if you select unimplemented features from the menu, you will
get a warning window.

INSTALLATION

To install gattrib, place the tarball in the directory where your gEDA
sources live.  Then do:

tar -zxvf geda-gattrib-20040806.tar.gz
cd geda-gattrib-20040806
./configure --prefix=/path/to/your/geda/stuff
make
make install

Note that you may need to set some environment variables first.  Also
remember to use a date code (20040806) corresponding to the current
gattrib distribution .  If your compilation barfs, try setting these
(for csh):   

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/geda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
setenv PATH /usr/local/geda/bin:$PATH
setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH /usr/local/geda/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Gattrib was cobbled together by Stuart Brorson starting in December
2003 from parts culled from GtkSheet (GTK+Extra) and gEDA.  Please
