2007-05-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20070526 in prep for the next
        release.

2007-04-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/gettext.h, include/globals.h, include/Makefile.am,
	src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c: Removed gettext.h header file
	and the few _( ) pairs to get rid of some warnings.  gattrib is
	not i18n and should not be using gettext.h for now.

	* src/s_toplevel.c: Removed some unused variable compiler warnings.

2007-04-21 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

	* src/x_dialog.c: Check return value of gdk_keyval_name() is non
	  NULL before attempting to match against it. Fixes bug #1692634.

2007-4-21  Stuart Brorson <sdb (AT) cloud9 (DOT) net>
	* src/x_window.c: Modify gattrib so it checks for design changes
	before quitting if user hits delete button on window.  Closes bug
	1704938 from Peter Brett.
	
2007-04-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves (AT) iespana (DOT) es>

	* src/x_fileselect.c:
	 - Set the alternative button order for gtk dialogs 
	   (now with correct responses).
	 - Reverted the changes below. 
	   gtk_dialog_set_alternative_button_order should have the same
	   responses as the dialogs.
	 - Set the alternative button order for gtk dialogs.
	  This would allow to display the correct button order whatever
	  system is running this app. Fix for bug #1553483.
	
2007-04-17 21:16  Dan McMahill <danmc>

2006-12-23 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/s_object.c (s_object_attrib_add_attrib_in_object):
	  Make o_selection_add call match the new selection interface.
	  The first argument should be a pointer to the selection list.

	column so user is prompted when quitting before saving.
	
2006-09-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* configure.ac : Applied patch #1564796 by Cesar Strauss, 
	enabling Cygwin's compilation. Thanks.
	
2006-09-23  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/gattrib.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Adapted for new file selection
	dialog.

	GtkFileChooser as in gschem.

2006-09-15 Stuart Brorson   <sdb (AT) cloud9 (DOT) net>
	* include/prototype.h, src/g_register.c, src/gattrib.c,
	src/x_dialog.c, src/x_gtksheet.c, src/x_window.c:
	Made gattrib throw up GUI window warning user of no
	components or attributes per request of Peter Clifton.
	Then program exits with non-zero return code.
	
2006-09-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated program version to 20060906.

	* src/g_rc.c, src/gattrib.c src/x_dialog.c: Added CUSTOM_VERSION to
	all printfs/output/dialog boxes where VERSION is used so that it is
	easier to create custom version of gEDA/gaf.

2006-08-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated gtk+ tests to look for 2.4.x or greater.

2006-08-21   SDB <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * include/prototype.h, src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Fixed
	bug in which adding a new attrib column would munge the 
	visibility of existing attributes.

2006-08-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * README: Updated the README a little to be ready for the next

	src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c:  Applied patch from Jeff Mallatt
	which implements ability to handle attrib strings with multiple
	= signs. 

2006-08-12  SDB <sdb@cloud9.net>

	src/s_visibility.c, src/x_fileselect.c, src/x_gtksheet.c,
	src/x_window.c:  Made cell text different colors depending
	upon attribute visibility.

2006-08-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/*.c: Applied Patch#1533798: Remove pre-GTK2 code from geda
        by Peter Brett.

	* src/gattrib.c, src/gtksheet_2_2.c, src/s_object.c, 
	src/s_rename.c, src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_string_list.c, 
	src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c,
	src/x_gtksheet.c, src/x_window.c: Changed all malloc/free calls to
	g_malloc/g_free to be consistent with libgeda

2006-06-03 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* src/gtksheet_2_2.c: Finally fixed annoying bug in which gattrib
	soaked up 70% of processor time.  Problem had to do with infinite
	loop of expose_events generated upon call
	to gdk_window_show(sheet->row_title_window) and 
	gdk_window_show(sheet->row_title_window) in gtk_sheet_expose.  I
	removed calls to fix bug.

2006-03-12 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gattribrc.in: Removed load for the system-gafrc file,
        since it is loaded by libgeda first.

2006-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20060123

	opening a schematic.
	
2005-09-27 18:45  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * src/: gtkitementry_2_2.c, gtksheet_2_2.c: remove various compiler
          warnings

2005-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped the package version to 20050820 which will be
        a real snapshot.

2005-08-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated package version to 20050814.  This is a 
        temporary version and not a real release number.

2005-07-13 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* src/s_visibility.c, s_table.c, s_object.c, s_toplevel.c 
	amongst others.  
	Made changes to enable setting attribute visibility from
	within gattrib.
	
2005-06-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/i_vars.c: Fixed some more variables which were shadowing the
	real variables in libgeda/noweb/i_vars.c.

2005-04-10 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	* src/gtkitementry_1_2.c, src/gtkitementry_2_2.c,
	  src/gtksheet_1_2.c src/gtksheet_2_2.c:
	  Fixed segmentation fault because lacking of "default_border" and 
	  "default_ouside_border" properties.

2005-04-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gattrib.c: Moved a variable decl to the top of the function to
	make gcc 2.96 happy.  

2005-03-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Removed all tests for gtk+ 1.2.x and fixed error 		message if gtk+ 2.2.x is not found.

2005-03-11 12:30 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * src/gtksheet*.c:  Incorporated definitions of default_border* 
	as suggested by Carlos.  A couple other possible bugfixes also.

2005-03-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20050313

2005-03-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        filenames on the command line again.

2005-03-06 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/s_table.c, src/x_dialog.c: Fix some uninitialized variables
	found by Dan McMahill & -wall gcc warning.
	
2005-02-21 05:29  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h,
	  include/x_menu.h, src/Makefile.am, src/gattrib.c, src/listsort.c,
	  src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c,
	  src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c, src/x_gtksheet.c: Fix many
	  instances of non-void functions not having return values.  Most
	  of these were simply changed to void functions since nothing
	  seemed to be expecting a return value.  While here, garbage
	  collect several unused variables to make the compiler warnings
	  easier to dig through.  Also if we're using gcc, then turn on
	  -Wall.

2005-02-21 03:58  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* autogen.sh: avoid using the '-path' primary to find(1) as it's an
	  extension to posix.2 and is not supported on some operating
	  systems such as solaris.  Now we can autogen.sh on solaris 9.

2005-02-20  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/gattrib.c (gattrib_main): Adapted for new logging system.

2005-02-19  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	adding picture support to libgeda.
	
2005-02-15 18:32  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/x_dialog.c: Modified GTK buttons slightly so the captions 
	fit the button, and the button usage matches the text.

2005-02-14 22:31  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* src/: gtkextra-marshal.c, gtkitementry_1_2.c, listsort.c: add
	  some missing config.h inclusions

2005-02-14 22:27  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* src/x_dialog.c: - move the config.h inclusion higher up so the
	  protected inclusion of string.h doesn't fail.

	  - fix a format string/# of arguments mismatch in a warning
	  string.

2005-02-13 11:30  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/s_table.c: Fixed syntax bug (doubled ;;) in 
	s_table_add_toplevel_pin_items_to_pin_table.
	
2005-02-13 01:40  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* src/s_string_list.c: fix 2 places where a pointer to an int was
	  being cast to an int and used as an int when we really wanted to
	  dereference the pointer instead.

2005-02-12  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/gattrib.c, src/i_vars.c, src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c,
	* src/x_fileselect.c:  Fixed program to compile and run after 
	Patrick's refactoring of libgeda.  Also made fileselect
	dialog stay on top of main window when gattrib is invoked with
	no args on cmd line.
	
2005-02-12  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c: Beautify buttons (use GTK stock).
	
2005-02-08 12:33  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* include/prototype.h, src/g_rc.c, src/g_register.c, src/gattrib.c:
	  get rid of deprecated guile gh_* functions and replace them with
	  the currently (guile-1.6) supported interface.

2005-02-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/gattrib.c, src/s_attrib.c, src/s_object.c:
	* src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_string_list.c, src/s_table.c:
	* src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c:
	* src/x_gtksheet.c, src/x_window.c: Replaced u_basic_strdup() and 
	u_basic_strdup_multiple() by GLib functions.
	
	* src/gattrib.c, src/x_fileselect.c:  Made it use GLib's 
	G_DIR_SEPARATOR* instead of libgeda's *_SEPARATER_*.

2005-01-27 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/gattrib.c: Changes made to enable correct opening
	of schematics in foreign directories.  Changes detailed 
	in libgeda ChangeLog.  

	
2005-01-22 (Later in same day) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* x_dialog.c, s_toplevel.c:  Rewrote missing symbol dialog box
	so that only one box is thrown up in event of missing symbols.
	
2005-01-22 (Later in same day) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* include/prototype.h, src/(s_attrib.c, s_sheet_data.c,
	s_table.c, s_toplevel.c,  x_dialog.c): New feature -- gattrib
	now handles slotted components correctly.
	
2005-01-22 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/s_toplevel.c, src/s_attrib.c, src/s_sheet_data, Makefile.am: 
	Fixed bug where pre-existing
	attribs were deleted instead of being replaced.  Added new fcn 
	in s_attrib.c as part of this bugfix.

	* include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, include/x_menu.h,
	src/gattrib.c, src/gtkitementry_2_2.c,src/gtksheet_2_2.c,
	src/x_dialog.c:  New feature -- check for unsaved chages
	before leaving program.

	* configure.ac:  Added --enable-debug as configure option.

	
2005-01-21 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c: Fix bug where only one
	page of design was searched for missing attribs.  Also updated
	missing_sym dialog box.
	
2005-01-19 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/(s_object.c, gattrib.c, s_toplevel.c,x_fileselect.c,
	x_dialog.c): Incorporated pop-up window which notifies
	user if a component is found with no sym file.
	
2004-12-28 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* lib/system-gattribrc.in:  Changed to refer to system-gafrc.

2004-12-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Changed the call to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to take
	the GEDA_VERSION so that packages get created with the right
	version number

	* src/s_toplevel.c, x_dialog.c: Added a few #ifdef HAS_GTK22 tests
	to get gattrib to build using gtk12.  The addition tests in x_dialog.c
	are probably okay, but the test in s_toplevel.c needs to be fixed
	properly.

	* Makefile.am: Added missing file to EXTRA_DIST variable

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228

2004-07-27  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

        *  Ported code to GTK+-2.X.  Re-wrote Makefile.am & configure.ac.  Split
	   gtksheet.c into two versions, one for GTK-1.2 and one for GTK-2.X.
	   (Both copied from gtkextra.sf.net.)
	
	*  Many fixes related to moving to GTK-2.X

	*  Incorporated Ales' fix for "for" loop which had i=i++ construct.

2004-07-13  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Eliminated spurious GTK warnings by testing for NULL in arguments 
	   before calling functions in gtksheet.c.

	*  Removed several extraneous files originally bundled with GtkSheet.

2004-06-25  Ales Hvezda  (Noted by SDB)

	*  Modified gattrib to work with soon-to-be-released libgeda 20040710.
	
2004-03-13  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Implemented alphabetic sort of master_comp_list.
	
	*  Placed references to g_rc_reset_component_library and other
	   Guile fcns into g_register to enable Sri's RC customized files.
	
2004-03-11  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

        *  Fixed bug in which a loop was terminating early, causing
	   large portions of some designs to be not processed.

	*  Added code to catch a cond where a design with no components
	   (i.e. no refdeses) or no modifiable attributes (i.e. no attribs
	   other than refdes) would cause a segfault.  Now program just
	   exits with an error message.
	
2004-03-06  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Fixed bug in which graphical objects were not discarded
	   during the "add master list" loop.  This generated a 
	   spurious warning message.

	*  Fixed configure.ac to fix the GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X problem
	   originally identified by Dan, and seen again by Sribalan 
	   Santhanam in rel 20040304.  Hopefully I fixed the bug this 
	   time! 
	
2004-03-04  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
	
	*  Fixed some compilation issues related to GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X.
	   Dan McMahill discovered the problem, and also provided the
	   patches fixing it.  Thanks, Dan!

	*  "make install" now correctly installs system-gattribrc into
	   the place where the gEDA RC files live.  I had forgotten to
	   include this into the last release, and you had to do it by
	   hand. 

2004-02-21  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
	
	*  Initial release.

2003-12-05  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* Started hacking.
