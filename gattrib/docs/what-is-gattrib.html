  What is gAttrib?
<p>
gattrib is the attribute editor for gschem, the schematic capture program/tool
which is part of gEDA. gattrib's sole purpose is to facilitate the editing of
attributes of components.
<p>
<h3>sdb_notes SDB's original comment in gattrib.c</h3>
In the spirit of open source/free software, major sections of gattrib's code
were borrowed from other sources, and hacked together by SDB in Dec. 2003.<br>
Particularly rich sources for code were gEDA/gnetlist, and the gtkextra program
testgtksheet.c.<br>
<br>
Thanks to their authors for providing the foundation upon which this is built.<br>
Of course, I <b>*did*</b> write major portions of the code too . . . . .<br>
Some documentation about the internal operation of this program can be found in
the "NOTES" file  in the gattrib top-level directory.<br>

- believed to still be relevant.<br>

gattrib has three major components:<br>
<ul>
<li>It manipulates objects held in the TOPLEVEL data structure.<br>
    It does this by importing structs and functions from libgeda.
<li>Gattrib defines its own layer of structs, notably SHEET_DATA, which holds a
    table of attrib name=value pairs, and also holds a couple of linked lists
    corresponding to all component's refdeses, and to all attribute names found
    in the design.<br>
    This stuff is native to gattrib.
<li>Gattrib uses a spreadsheet widget called GtkSheet.<br>
    This stuff came from the GtkExtra project, which at one time offered a bunch
    of interesting widgets for graphing and visualization.<br>
    I think they're still around; you can do a Google search for them.<br>
    I stole the two .h files defining the spreadsheet widgets, and also stole
    code from the program itself to implement the run-time functions which deal
    with the spreadsheet.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
When run, gattrib does this:<br>
<ul>
<li>It uses libgeda functions to read in your design, and fill up the TOPLEVEL
    struct.
<li>It then loops over everything in TOPLEVEL and fills out the refdes list and
    the attribute name list. It sticks these into a STRING_LIST which is
    associated with the SHEET_DATA struct.
<li>Then, knowing all the refdeses and all the attribute names, it creates a
    TABLE data struct (a member of SHEET_DATA), and loops over each cell in the
    TABLE.<br>
    For each cell, it queries TOPLEVEL for the corresponding name=value pair,
    and sticks the value in the TABLE.
<li>When done with that, it then creates a GtkSheet and populates it by looping
    over TABLE.
<li>Then it turns over control to the user, who can manipulate the GtkSheet.<br>
    As the user adds and deletes values from the GtkSheet, the values are stored
    locally there.<br>
    The GtkSheet is the master repository of all attributes at that point; the
    other data structures are not updated.
</ul>
    Saving out a design is similar, except the process runs in reverse:<br>
<ul>
<li>The program loops over all cells in GtkSheet, and sticks the values found
    into SHEET_DATA.<br>
    Handling issues like added/deleted columns happens first at the GtkSheet,
    and then to SHEET_DATA and TOPLEVEL.<br>
    I've kind of forgotten how I implemented these feaures, however. :-S
<li>Then, the program loops over the cells in SHEET_DATA, and updates the
    attributes in TOPLEVEL using functions from libgeda, as well as by reaching
    directly into the TOPLEVEL data structure (a software engineering no-no).<br>
    If a previously existing attrib has been removed, then it is removed from
    TOPLEVEL.<br>
    If a new attrib has been attached to a component, then it is added to
    TOPLEVEL.
<li>Then the design is saved out using the save function from libgeda.
</ul>
<p>
Therefore, think of SHEET_DATA and the other gattrib data structures as a thin
layer between GtkSheet and TOPLEVEL.<br>
The gattrib data structures are used basically for convenience while trying to
build or update either of the two other, more important data structures.
