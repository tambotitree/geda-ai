2006-09-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	
	* include/struct.h, src/s_check.c, src/s_symstruct.c:
	Applied patch #1558391 by Jeff Mallatt, slightly modified so
	it doesn't use goto's. Thanks.
	
	Counts the number of distinct pinnumbers specified in
	all slotdef= attributes. Uses that number, plus the
	number of net= pins, to compare with the "footprint
	size" when checking for that warning.

	The code used to simply use numpins*numslots, which
	doesn't account for the possibility of the same
	pinnumber being used in more than one slotdef= attribute.

	For an example of a symbol where this matters, see
	'analog/dual-opamp-1.sym'.

	* include/pincounts.h, include/struct.h, include/prototype.h, 
	src/s_check.c, src/s_symstruct.c: Applied patch by Jim Duchek which
	adds several important tests to gsymcheck: 

		net=Vcc:8,15,14 (for example) is now checked against
		the pinnumber= attribs for duplicates.	footprint=
		is checked to get the proper pincount (I included some
		support for special cases like TO92, which doesn't
		quite have 92 pins :), and the number of pins defined
		vs. the number of pins that SHOULD be defined is compared.
		Total pins are found by: total = num_net_pins + (numslots
		* numpins).  Of course if numslots == 0 that multiplier
		doesn't happen.
	
	* tests/incorrect_footprint.sym duplicate_net.sym: Added a couple
	test symbols to exercise the above patch
