  # - For MIME: You might need to ensure your package's XML MIME file is in $TARGET_DIR
  #   and then, if a local 'update-mime-database' equivalent exists or can be built, run it.
  #   Often, just installing the .xml file to $PREFIX/share/mime/packages is enough if
  #   $PREFIX/share is in XDG_DATA_DIRS.
  # - For .desktop files: Similar, installing to $PREFIX/share/applications.
  #   A local 'update-desktop-database' might be needed if applications are not picked up.
  # For now, this script could just be a placeholder:
  echo "Placeholder: Implement local XDG update logic for ${TYPE} in ${TARGET_DIR}"
