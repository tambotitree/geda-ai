This directory contains the testsuite for the "gxyrs" script.
No modifications to this script are allowed without adding tests here.
If a bug report is filed, a test must be added to show the bug before
it is allowed to be fixed.

If you require additional input files, add them in the inputs/ directory.
Reference output files go in outputs/.  Add the test description to
tests.list.

To regenerate the reference files, type:

	make check REGEN=1

Use this with caution. In particular, all differences should be noted
and understood. You must hand verify the results before committing to
the repository.
