.SH NAME
.B schdiff
\- Graphical diff tool for schematics

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B schdiff
.I infile1.sch infile2.sch


.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B schdiff
program will use 
.B ImageMagick(1)
to display a graphical diff of two gschem schematic files.  It's most useful
when combined with a revision control system so it can compare two revisions of
the same file, review changes, etc.  However, it is limited in that it can only
compare two files at a time; it cannot diff entire directories nor can it diff
an entire revision (unless that revision affected only one file).  It can
easily be configured to work with most revision control systems.  Here are
instructions for three:

.B git:
Use the 
.B difftool
command exactly as you would use
.B diff
, but supply the
.B \-x schdiff
option.

.B mercurial:
Use the 
.B schdiff
command exactly as you would use
.B diff
, but add the following lines to your .hgrc:

.RS
  [extensions]
  hgext.extdiff =
  [extdiff]
  cmd.schdiff = schdiff
.RE

.B subversion:
Use the
.B diff
command like normal, but supply the
.B --diff-cmd schdiff
option.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
