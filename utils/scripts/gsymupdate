# This program takes a symbol filename on the command line and outputs an 
# update symbol to stdout.  
#
# This program does the following modifications to a symbol
#
#    - Removes all pin#=# attributes, converting them into pinseq= and 
#      pinnumber= attributes
#    - Removes all slot#=# attributes, converting them into slotdef= attributes
#
# Right now this program should only be run against symbols which are 
# either version 20020527 or earlier.
