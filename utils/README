- Utilities

   gmk_sym		
   Updated by Matthew Ettus, matt@ettus.com

	Jerry's instructions below still work.  There are
	additional features for the first input line.
	See TL16C554AFN.txt for an example of the extended input

   Written by: Jerry O'Keefe, jerryok@pacbell.net 

	This is a simple utility to convert comma separated
	descriptions into rectangular gschem symbols.  It should
	be useful for easily creating memory, processors or
	connector style parts. All pin positions are in normal pin
	spacing (300).	Pin styles supported are line, dot-line,
	and clock line. Pins can be placed on all sides of the
	symbol's box. For example to place a dot-line style pin of
	name INPUT at the normal pin 1 position of a IC would be:

		INPUT,1,dot,L,1

	The size of the symbol's box is also in pin spacings. So
	a symbol with 6 inputs and 6 outputs would typically
	require a size of: 3 for width and 7 for height.

	See the included 7474.txt and 8031.txt as example files.

	This utility is not strong on error checking and slotting
	is not supported.
		
	gmk_sym typical use:

		./gmk_sym 7474.txt >7474-3.sym

	gmk_sym is installed when make install is run.



   smash_megafile		
   Written by: Mike Jarabek, mjarabek@istop.com

	smash_megafile is a C program that will take a viewlogic
	megafile and extract the contents into a directory of the same
	name, with one file representing each element in the library.
	This program should compile without any problems for anyone.
	This program cannot create megafiles, it can just extract all
	the contents. (Useful for say, extracting all the symbols from
	a library...)  Be aware that megafiles from PC versions of
	ViewDraw use PC end of line terminations, it may be necessary
	to use a program like dos2unix to convert the resulting text
	files... before doing useful things with them.

	smash_megafile typical use:

		 ./smash_megafile megafile

	where megafile is the name of a viewlogic megafile whithout
	any extensions.  The file megafile.lib and megafile.tbl must
	exist in the same directory

	smash_megafile is installed when make install is run.


   convert_sym
   Written by: Mike Jarabek, mjarabek@istop.com

	convert_sym converts Viewlogic schematics and symbols into
	geda format.

	This utility should be considered a work in progress.
	Be warned, the program has a few limitations:

		1) Some text spacing may be lost due to the way that I
		   extract the text from the viewlogic records

		2) Arcs in viewlogic are stored implicitly as a record
		   where the arc passes through three points,
		   the conversion from this format to geda's
		   center/radius/start/stop notation is not exact,
		   so some arcs may not render well.

		3) Bubbles are drawn on pins that are negated.	I believe
		   the code is correct, but have not tried all the
		   end cases.

		4) Rotated and mirrored components may not show up correctly,
		   but should be better now, thanks to patches from 
                   Thepthai Tabtieng <tabtieng@lsil.com>.


	convert_sym (the C version) typical use:

		convert_sym -s viewlogic_symbol.1 > viewlogic_symbol-1.sym

		convert_sym viewlogic_schematic.1 > viewlogic_schematic-1.sch

	convert_sym is installed when make install is run.

	Thanks to Thepthai Tabtieng <tabtieng@lsil.com> for code to
	support rotated and mirrored components, and a fix for
	component instantiations.
		

    Sarlacc (consists of sarlacc_schem and sarlacc_sym)
    Written by: Matthew Ettus

    Sarlacc is an OrCAD to gEDA format schematic converter. This software is 
    beta, so it still has limitations.  To convert files do the following:

      * Go into ORCAD, load up your schematic, and save it as "SDT IV format".
        All of the versions of ORCAD should be able to do this.  This
        is the old ORCAD 16 bit format.  In this process, your library parts 
        will be converted to a new format.  Along the way, there is an
        intermediate format which is all text.  It is probably kept in your 
        tmp directory (C:\windows\temp ?), and it has a .src extension. 
        Save this file too. 
      * To convert schematics type:  sarlacc_schem orcadfile > gedafile.sch 
      * To convert symbols type: sarlacc_sym orcadlibrary.src 
          This will create individual .sym files for gschem. You will need to 
          put them somewhere gschem will find them


    olib
    Written by: Mario Pascucci

    olib is a simple automated converter from OrCAD(tm) v4 (in SDT version
    1.10) parts library (in ASCII dump format, through "decomp" utility)
    to gEDA component definition in .sym format file.

    
    refdes_renum
    Dan McMahill

    refdes_renum reads a gschem schematic file or files and renumbers
    all reference designators.  The reference designators are numbered
    starting with 1 and the old schematic file is replaced by the modified
    schematic file.

    Run the program with no parameters or with --help to see usage 
    information.


    tragesym
    Werner Hoch

    tragesym is a symbol creator for gEDA/gaf.  The aim of this python
    script is to make it easier (and faster) to create symbols for gEDA.

    Program features:

    * create pins and arrange their elements (clocksign, dot, type, pinnumber, 
      label)
    * sort pins alphabetical and numerical
    * swap words of pinlabels if wished
    * draw negation lines on the labels
    * rotate pinlabels if wished
    * some syntax check to the input file
 
    Please see the README.tragesym and ChangeLog.tragesym for more info.  
    Be sure to look at the examples in examples/tragesym.  There you will
    find the template.src file referenced in the README.tragesym file.


    pads_backannotate
    Dan McMahill

    A perl program which implements backannotation from Pads PowerPCB 
    board layouts to gschem schematics.
   
    Please see the pads_backannotate.[dvi|html|ps|pdf] documentation for more
    details.

   
    gsch2pcb 
    Bill Wilson
  
    gsch2pcb is conceptually based on the gschem2pcb shell script
    distributed with gnetlist, but additionally handles multiple
    schematics, handles element file footprints, and removes pc board
    elements corresponding to components deleted from the schematics.
    It also forward annotates component value changes.

    Please see the README.gsch2pcb file for more information.  Also see
    examples/gsch2pcb/project.sample for an example of a project file.


    garchive
    Stuart Brorson

    This program is used to create a gEDA design archive.  It operates
    in two modes: archive mode and extract mode.  In archive mode it
    creates a project archive from a bunch of project files, and in
    extract mode it extracts the files from the archive and places them in
    the local dir.

    garchive requires python to run.  
    Run:  garchive -h  for help information.
 
    
    schdiff
    Alan Somers
    This script is used to produce graphical diffs of gschem files.  It 
    integrates with Git, Mercurial, and Subversion.  It requires ImageMagick
    to run.  Run schdiff -h for usage instructions.
